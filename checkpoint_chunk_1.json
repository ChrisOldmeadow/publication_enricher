This information can be used for policy and long-term health investment, planning, and prioritisation. We have expanded and improved upon previous forecasts produced as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) and provide a reference forecast (the most likely future), and alternative scenarios assessing disease burden trajectories if selected sets of risk factors were eliminated from current levels by 2050. Methods Using forecasts of major drivers of health such as the Socio-demographic Index (SDI; a composite measure of lag-distributed income per capita, mean years of education, and total fertility under 25 years of age) and the full set of risk factor exposures captured by GBD, we provide cause-specific forecasts of mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) by age and sex from 2022 to 2050 for 204 countries and territories, 21 GBD regions, seven super-regions, and the world. All analyses were done at the cause-specific level so that only risk factors deemed causal by the GBD comparative risk assessment influenced future trajectories of mortality for each disease. Cause-specific mortality was modelled using mixed-effects models with SDI and time as the main covariates, and the combined impact of causal risk factors as an offset in the model. At the all-cause mortality level, we captured unexplained variation by modelling residuals with an autoregressive integrated moving average model with drift attenuation. These all-cause forecasts constrained the cause-specific forecasts at successively deeper levels of the GBD cause hierarchy using cascading mortality models, thus ensuring a robust estimate of cause-specific mortality. For non-fatal measures (eg, low back pain), incidence and prevalence were forecasted from mixed-effects models with SDI as the main covariate, and YLDs were computed from the resulting prevalence forecasts and average disability weights from GBD. Alternative future scenarios were constructed by replacing appropriate reference trajectories for risk factors with hypothetical trajectories of gradual elimination of risk factor exposure from current levels to 2050. The scenarios were constructed from various sets of risk factors: environmental risks (Safer Environment scenario), risks associated with communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases (CMNNs; Improved Childhood Nutrition and Vaccination scenario), risks associated with major non-communicable diseases (NCDs; Improved Behavioural and Metabolic Risks scenario), and the combined effects of these three scenarios. Using the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways climate scenarios SSP2-4.5 as reference and SSP1-1.9 as an optimistic alternative in the Safer Environment scenario, we accounted for climate change impact on health by using the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change temperature forecasts and published trajectories of ambient air pollution for the same two scenarios. Life expectancy and healthy life expectancy were computed using standard methods. The forecasting framework includes computing the age-sex-specific future population for each location and separately for each scenario. 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for each individual future estimate were derived from the 2\u00b75th and 97\u00b75th percentiles of distributions generated from propagating 500 draws through the multistage computational pipeline. Findings In the reference scenario forecast, global and super-regional life expectancy increased from 2022 to 2050, but improvement was at a slower pace than in the three decades preceding the COVID-19 pandemic (beginning in 2020). Gains in future life expectancy were forecasted to be greatest in super-regions with comparatively low life expectancies (such as sub-Saharan Africa) compared with super-regions with higher life expectancies (such as the high-income super-region), leading to a trend towards convergence in life expectancy across locations between now and 2050. At the super-region level, forecasted healthy life expectancy patterns were similar to those of life expectancies. Forecasts for the reference scenario found that health will improve in the coming decades, with all-cause age-standardised DALY rates decreasing in every GBD super-region. The total DALY burden measured in counts, however, will increase in every super-region, largely a function of population ageing and growth. We also forecasted that both DALY counts and age-standardised DALY rates will continue to shift from CMNNs to NCDs, with the most pronounced shifts occurring in sub-Saharan Africa (60\u00b71% [95% UI 56\u00b78\u201363\u00b71] of DALYs were from CMNNs in 2022 compared with 35\u00b78% [31\u00b70\u201345\u00b70] in 2050) and south Asia (31\u00b77% [29\u00b72\u201334\u00b71] to 15\u00b75% [13\u00b77\u201317\u00b75]). This shift is reflected in the leading global causes of DALYs, with the top four causes in 2050 being ischaemic heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, compared with 2022, with ischaemic heart disease, neonatal disorders, stroke, and lower respiratory infections at the top. The global proportion of DALYs due to YLDs likewise increased from 33\u00b78% (27\u00b74\u201340\u00b73) to 41\u00b71% (33\u00b79\u201348\u00b71) from 2022 to 2050, demonstrating an important shift in overall disease burden towards morbidity and away from premature death. The largest shift of this kind was forecasted for sub-Saharan Africa, from 20\u00b71% (15\u00b76\u201325\u00b73) of DALYs due to YLDs in 2022 to 35\u00b76% (26\u00b75\u201343\u00b70) in 2050. In the assessment of alternative future scenarios, the combined effects of the scenarios (Safer Environment, Improved Childhood Nutrition and Vaccination, and Improved Behavioural and Metabolic Risks scenarios) demonstrated an important decrease in the global burden of DALYs in 2050 of 15\u00b74% (13\u00b75\u201317\u00b75) compared with the reference scenario, with decreases across super-regions ranging from 10\u00b74% (9\u00b77\u201311\u00b73) in the high-income super-region to 23\u00b79% (20\u00b77\u201327\u00b73) in north Africa and the Middle East. The Safer Environment scenario had its largest decrease in sub-Saharan Africa (5\u00b72% [3\u00b75\u20136\u00b78]), the Improved Behavioural and Metabolic Risks scenario in north Africa and the Middle East (23\u00b72% [20\u00b72\u201326\u00b75]), and the Improved Nutrition and Vaccination scenario in sub-Saharan Africa (2\u00b70% [\u20130\u00b76 to 3\u00b76]). Interpretation Globally, life expectancy and age-standardised disease burden were forecasted to improve between 2022 and 2050, with the majority of the burden continuing to shift from CMNNs to NCDs. That said, continued progress on reducing the CMNN disease burden will be dependent on maintaining investment in and policy emphasis on CMNN disease prevention and treatment. Mostly due to growth and ageing of populations, the number of deaths and DALYs due to all causes combined will generally increase. By constructing alternative future scenarios wherein certain risk exposures are eliminated by 2050, we have shown that opportunities exist to substantially improve health outcomes in the future through concerted efforts to prevent exposure to well established risk factors and to expand access to key health interventions.

Promoting positive teacher wellbeing substantially influences teaching quality, with a flow-on effect on student wellbeing and academic development. This literature review utilised a framework to systematically explore the factors that impact the occupational wellbeing of kindergarten, primary, and secondary schoolteachers. Thirty-eight (38) studies from an initial 3766 peer-reviewed articles sourced from various databases (CINAHL, Emcare, PychINFO, Scopus, ERIC, and PsycARTICLES) were utilized for this systematic review. Four major factors were identified, including personal capabilities, socioemotional competence, personal responses to work conditions, and professional relationships. Findings highlight the importance of teachers\u2019 occupational wellbeing in dealing with numerous challenges and competing demands, with the need for a high level of self-efficacy for instruction and behavioural management being critically significant. Teachers require adequate organisational support to successfully carry out their roles with stronger resilience and efficient job execution. Teachers also need to have social\u2013emotional competence to be able to create a high-quality classroom environment and a conducive atmosphere that supports healthy teacher\u2013student relationships, reduces stress and increases the occupational wellbeing of teachers. Collaborating with other relevant stakeholders such as parents, colleagues, and a school\u2019s leadership team is critical for creating a positive work environment. A good workplace has the potential to contribute to teachers\u2019 occupational wellbeing and provide a supportive platform for student learning and engagement. This review clearly points to the beneficial effects of prioritising teachers\u2019 occupational wellbeing and its intentional inclusion in the professional development plan of practising teachers. Finally, while primary school teachers and secondary school teachers share many similarities in terms of the challenges they face, there are also some differences in how these challenges impact their wellbeing, and these warrant further investigation.</jats:p>", "source": "crossref", "match_info": {"fuzzy_matched": false, "query_doi": "10.3390/IJERPH20126070", "match_type": "doi"}}, {"Publication_ID": 599157, "title": "The development of recommendations for the assessment and management of sesamoiditis by podiatrists: A Delphi and content validity study", "doi": "10.1002/JFA2.12025", "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:sec><jats:title>Introduction</jats:title><jats:p>Sesamoiditis is a common, and often painful, musculoskeletal pathology frequently encountered by podiatrists.

The aim of this study was to deepen understanding of the policy objectives of UK alcohol and tobacco tax options being considered at the time of the interviews with a set of UK policy participants in 2018, and the factors affecting the implementation and outcomes of the policy options discussed. Methods Ten tax policy experts were recruited from government arms-length organisations and advocacy groups in England and Scotland (4 alcohol, 4 tobacco, 2 alcohol and tobacco). Alcohol and tobacco experts were interviewed together in pairs and asked to discuss alcohol and tobacco tax policy objectives, options, and the mechanisms of effect. Interviews were semi-structured, supported by a briefing document and topic guide, audio-recorded, transcribed and then analysed deductively using framework analysis. Results Alcohol and tobacco tax policy share objectives of health improvement and there is a common set of policy options: increasing duty rates, duty escalators, multi-rate tax structures, industry levies and the hypothecation of tax revenue for investment in societal benefits. However, participants agreed that the harms caused by alcohol and tobacco and their industries are viewed differently, and that this influences the impacts that are prioritised in tax policymaking. Working-out how alcohol and tobacco taxes could work synergistically to reduce health inequalities was seen as desirable. Participants also highlighted the importance of avoiding the combined effects of price increases on alcohol and tobacco widening economic inequalities.

However, faulty data in practice are still rare because of the \"safety oriented principle\". For this purpose, fault injection is regularly employed. Due to the stochastic nature of faults in the system, random fault injection can more realistically simulate faulty scenarios compared to the deterministic fault injection. The traditional method entails analyzing a significant amount of raw data to extract the fault distribution function, followed by random sampling. However, the obstacles lie in the scarcity of raw fault data and the labor-intensive nature of constructing the fault distribution function. This paper proposes a layered random fault injection method based on multiple Markov chains. First, a multi-layer structured fault model base is established for the system, followed by the implementation of layered fault injection. Then, the random fault types and degrees are realized using Markov chains, in which the fault probability function is determined by the state transition matrix. Subsequently, a low-complexity Alias sampling algorithm is proposed for discrete random sampling. The nominal model is transformed into a corresponding fault model based on the sampling outcomes, facilitating the acquisition of fault data. Finally, a graphical user interface is developed to present and visualize the validation results.</jats:p>", "source": "crossref", "match_info": {"fuzzy_matched": false, "query_doi": "10.20517/CES.2024.02", "match_type": "doi"}}, {"Publication_ID": 594050, "title": "Improvement of the thalamocortical white matter network in people with stable treated relapsing\u2013remitting multiple sclerosis over time", "doi": "10.1002/NBM.5119", "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Advanced imaging techniques (tractography) enable the mapping of white matter (WM) pathways and the understanding of brain connectivity patterns.

This represents a previously unrecognised role for MIF in the regulation of inflammation and points to MIF as a potential therapeutic target for the management of severe neutrophilic asthma.</jats:p></jats:sec>", "source": "crossref", "match_info": {"fuzzy_matched": false, "query_doi": "10.1136/THORAX-2021-218555", "match_type": "doi"}}, {"Publication_ID": 586654, "title": "Anti-phishing: A comprehensive perspective", "doi": "10.1016/J.ESWA.2023.122199"}, {"Publication_ID": 613763, "title": "Language and reading impairments are associated with increased prevalence of non- right- handedness (vol 94, pg 970, 2023)", "doi": "10.1111/CDEV.14004"}, {"Publication_ID": 608418, "title": "Barriers and enablers to addressing smoking, nutrition, alcohol consumption, physical activity and gestational weight gain (SNAP-W) as part of antenatal care: A mixed methods systematic review", "doi": "10.1186/S43058-024-00655-Z", "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Background</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>International clinical guidelines recommend that smoking, nutrition, alcohol consumption, physical activity and gestational weight gain (SNAP-W) be addressed as part of routine antenatal care throughout pregnancy.

The studies were conducted in 14 countries. Data were collected from 7146 antenatal care providers (midwives, Aboriginal health workers, obstetricians, medical officers, general practitioners) and 352 barriers and enablers were identified. Across all SNAP-W health risk and antenatal care provider groups, the predominant TDF domain was \u2018environmental context and resources\u2019, identified in 96% of studies. Barriers within this domain included insufficient time, limited access to and quality of resources, and limited organisational supports. \u2018Beliefs about consequences\u2019 was the second most common TDF domain, reported in 67% of studies, particularly studies of care related to alcohol use, nutrition/ physical activity/ gestational weight gain and those involving midwives, multidisciplinary practitioners and general practitioners. \u2018Optimism\u2019 was the second most common TDF domain for studies of smoking-related care and involving obstetricians, gynaecologists, and other mixed medical professions.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>It is critical that determinants related to environmental context and resources including time, resources and organisational supports are considered in the development of strategies to support the implementation of recommended antenatal care related to SNAP-W risks.

The anticancer effect of zinc is typically linked to its antioxidant abilities and protecting cells against oxidative stress. Zinc regulates key processes in cancer development, including DNA repair, gene expression, and apoptosis. We took a blood sample from 989 female BRCA1 mutation carriers who were initially unaffected by cancer and followed them for a mean of 7.5 years thereafter. There were 172 incident cases of cancer, including 121 cases of breast cancer, 29 cases of ovarian cancers, and 22 cancers at other sites. A zinc level in the lowest tertile was associated with a modestly higher risk of ovarian cancer compared to women with zinc levels in the upper two tertiles (HR = 1.65; 95% CI 0.80 to 3.44; p = 0.18), but this was not significant. Among those women with zinc levels in the lowest tertile, the 10-year cumulative risk of ovarian cancer was 6.1%. Among those in the top two tertiles of zinc level, the ten-year cumulative risk of ovarian cancer was 4.7%. There was no significant association between zinc level and breast cancer risk. Our preliminary study does not support an association between serum zinc level and cancer risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers.</jats:p>", "source": "crossref", "match_info": {"fuzzy_matched": false, "query_doi": "10.3390/ANTIOX13050609", "match_type": "doi"}}, {"Publication_ID": 607825, "title": "What Are Eating Disorders?", "doi": "10.1093/wentk/9780190926595.003.0001", "abstract": "<p>\nThe term <italic>eating disorders</italic> refers to a group of illnesses characterized by disturbances in eating and eating-related behaviors.
