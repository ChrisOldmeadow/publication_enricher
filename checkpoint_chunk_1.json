This information can be used for policy and long-term health investment, planning, and prioritisation. We have expanded and improved upon previous forecasts produced as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) and provide a reference forecast (the most likely future), and alternative scenarios assessing disease burden trajectories if selected sets of risk factors were eliminated from current levels by 2050. Methods Using forecasts of major drivers of health such as the Socio-demographic Index (SDI; a composite measure of lag-distributed income per capita, mean years of education, and total fertility under 25 years of age) and the full set of risk factor exposures captured by GBD, we provide cause-specific forecasts of mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) by age and sex from 2022 to 2050 for 204 countries and territories, 21 GBD regions, seven super-regions, and the world. All analyses were done at the cause-specific level so that only risk factors deemed causal by the GBD comparative risk assessment influenced future trajectories of mortality for each disease. Cause-specific mortality was modelled using mixed-effects models with SDI and time as the main covariates, and the combined impact of causal risk factors as an offset in the model. At the all-cause mortality level, we captured unexplained variation by modelling residuals with an autoregressive integrated moving average model with drift attenuation. These all-cause forecasts constrained the cause-specific forecasts at successively deeper levels of the GBD cause hierarchy using cascading mortality models, thus ensuring a robust estimate of cause-specific mortality. For non-fatal measures (eg, low back pain), incidence and prevalence were forecasted from mixed-effects models with SDI as the main covariate, and YLDs were computed from the resulting prevalence forecasts and average disability weights from GBD. Alternative future scenarios were constructed by replacing appropriate reference trajectories for risk factors with hypothetical trajectories of gradual elimination of risk factor exposure from current levels to 2050. The scenarios were constructed from various sets of risk factors: environmental risks (Safer Environment scenario), risks associated with communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases (CMNNs; Improved Childhood Nutrition and Vaccination scenario), risks associated with major non-communicable diseases (NCDs; Improved Behavioural and Metabolic Risks scenario), and the combined effects of these three scenarios. Using the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways climate scenarios SSP2-4.5 as reference and SSP1-1.9 as an optimistic alternative in the Safer Environment scenario, we accounted for climate change impact on health by using the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change temperature forecasts and published trajectories of ambient air pollution for the same two scenarios. Life expectancy and healthy life expectancy were computed using standard methods. The forecasting framework includes computing the age-sex-specific future population for each location and separately for each scenario. 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for each individual future estimate were derived from the 2\u00b75th and 97\u00b75th percentiles of distributions generated from propagating 500 draws through the multistage computational pipeline. Findings In the reference scenario forecast, global and super-regional life expectancy increased from 2022 to 2050, but improvement was at a slower pace than in the three decades preceding the COVID-19 pandemic (beginning in 2020). Gains in future life expectancy were forecasted to be greatest in super-regions with comparatively low life expectancies (such as sub-Saharan Africa) compared with super-regions with higher life expectancies (such as the high-income super-region), leading to a trend towards convergence in life expectancy across locations between now and 2050. At the super-region level, forecasted healthy life expectancy patterns were similar to those of life expectancies. Forecasts for the reference scenario found that health will improve in the coming decades, with all-cause age-standardised DALY rates decreasing in every GBD super-region. The total DALY burden measured in counts, however, will increase in every super-region, largely a function of population ageing and growth. We also forecasted that both DALY counts and age-standardised DALY rates will continue to shift from CMNNs to NCDs, with the most pronounced shifts occurring in sub-Saharan Africa (60\u00b71% [95% UI 56\u00b78\u201363\u00b71] of DALYs were from CMNNs in 2022 compared with 35\u00b78% [31\u00b70\u201345\u00b70] in 2050) and south Asia (31\u00b77% [29\u00b72\u201334\u00b71] to 15\u00b75% [13\u00b77\u201317\u00b75]). This shift is reflected in the leading global causes of DALYs, with the top four causes in 2050 being ischaemic heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, compared with 2022, with ischaemic heart disease, neonatal disorders, stroke, and lower respiratory infections at the top. The global proportion of DALYs due to YLDs likewise increased from 33\u00b78% (27\u00b74\u201340\u00b73) to 41\u00b71% (33\u00b79\u201348\u00b71) from 2022 to 2050, demonstrating an important shift in overall disease burden towards morbidity and away from premature death. The largest shift of this kind was forecasted for sub-Saharan Africa, from 20\u00b71% (15\u00b76\u201325\u00b73) of DALYs due to YLDs in 2022 to 35\u00b76% (26\u00b75\u201343\u00b70) in 2050. In the assessment of alternative future scenarios, the combined effects of the scenarios (Safer Environment, Improved Childhood Nutrition and Vaccination, and Improved Behavioural and Metabolic Risks scenarios) demonstrated an important decrease in the global burden of DALYs in 2050 of 15\u00b74% (13\u00b75\u201317\u00b75) compared with the reference scenario, with decreases across super-regions ranging from 10\u00b74% (9\u00b77\u201311\u00b73) in the high-income super-region to 23\u00b79% (20\u00b77\u201327\u00b73) in north Africa and the Middle East. The Safer Environment scenario had its largest decrease in sub-Saharan Africa (5\u00b72% [3\u00b75\u20136\u00b78]), the Improved Behavioural and Metabolic Risks scenario in north Africa and the Middle East (23\u00b72% [20\u00b72\u201326\u00b75]), and the Improved Nutrition and Vaccination scenario in sub-Saharan Africa (2\u00b70% [\u20130\u00b76 to 3\u00b76]). Interpretation Globally, life expectancy and age-standardised disease burden were forecasted to improve between 2022 and 2050, with the majority of the burden continuing to shift from CMNNs to NCDs. That said, continued progress on reducing the CMNN disease burden will be dependent on maintaining investment in and policy emphasis on CMNN disease prevention and treatment. Mostly due to growth and ageing of populations, the number of deaths and DALYs due to all causes combined will generally increase. By constructing alternative future scenarios wherein certain risk exposures are eliminated by 2050, we have shown that opportunities exist to substantially improve health outcomes in the future through concerted efforts to prevent exposure to well established risk factors and to expand access to key health interventions.

These experiences often result in high stress levels that contribute to burnout and, consequently, a breach of teachers\u2019 occupational wellbeing. Promoting positive teacher wellbeing substantially influences teaching quality, with a flow-on effect on student wellbeing and academic development. This literature review utilised a framework to systematically explore the factors that impact the occupational wellbeing of kindergarten, primary, and secondary schoolteachers. Thirty-eight (38) studies from an initial 3766 peer-reviewed articles sourced from various databases (CINAHL, Emcare, PychINFO, Scopus, ERIC, and PsycARTICLES) were utilized for this systematic review. Four major factors were identified, including personal capabilities, socioemotional competence, personal responses to work conditions, and professional relationships. Findings highlight the importance of teachers\u2019 occupational wellbeing in dealing with numerous challenges and competing demands, with the need for a high level of self-efficacy for instruction and behavioural management being critically significant. Teachers require adequate organisational support to successfully carry out their roles with stronger resilience and efficient job execution. Teachers also need to have social\u2013emotional competence to be able to create a high-quality classroom environment and a conducive atmosphere that supports healthy teacher\u2013student relationships, reduces stress and increases the occupational wellbeing of teachers. Collaborating with other relevant stakeholders such as parents, colleagues, and a school\u2019s leadership team is critical for creating a positive work environment. A good workplace has the potential to contribute to teachers\u2019 occupational wellbeing and provide a supportive platform for student learning and engagement. This review clearly points to the beneficial effects of prioritising teachers\u2019 occupational wellbeing and its intentional inclusion in the professional development plan of practising teachers. Finally, while primary school teachers and secondary school teachers share many similarities in terms of the challenges they face, there are also some differences in how these challenges impact their wellbeing, and these warrant further investigation.</jats:p>", "source": "crossref"}, {"Publication_ID": 599157, "title": "The development of recommendations for the assessment and management of sesamoiditis by podiatrists: A Delphi and content validity study", "doi": "10.1002/JFA2.12025", "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:sec><jats:title>Introduction</jats:title><jats:p>Sesamoiditis is a common, and often painful, musculoskeletal pathology frequently encountered by podiatrists.

They were not required to change their cannabis exposure patterns. Participants were assessed at baseline and post-CBD exposure with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a functional MRI resting-state task (eyes closed).

The aim of this study was to deepen understanding of the policy objectives of UK alcohol and tobacco tax options being considered at the time of the interviews with a set of UK policy participants in 2018, and the factors affecting the implementation and outcomes of the policy options discussed. Methods Ten tax policy experts were recruited from government arms-length organisations and advocacy groups in England and Scotland (4 alcohol, 4 tobacco, 2 alcohol and tobacco). Alcohol and tobacco experts were interviewed together in pairs and asked to discuss alcohol and tobacco tax policy objectives, options, and the mechanisms of effect. Interviews were semi-structured, supported by a briefing document and topic guide, audio-recorded, transcribed and then analysed deductively using framework analysis. Results Alcohol and tobacco tax policy share objectives of health improvement and there is a common set of policy options: increasing duty rates, duty escalators, multi-rate tax structures, industry levies and the hypothecation of tax revenue for investment in societal benefits. However, participants agreed that the harms caused by alcohol and tobacco and their industries are viewed differently, and that this influences the impacts that are prioritised in tax policymaking. Working-out how alcohol and tobacco taxes could work synergistically to reduce health inequalities was seen as desirable. Participants also highlighted the importance of avoiding the combined effects of price increases on alcohol and tobacco widening economic inequalities.

The aim of this study was to determine the intrafraction motion and planning target volume (PTV) margins required for an OART workflow on the Varian Ethos system. Methods and Materials Sixty-five fractions from 13 previously treated OART patients were analyzed for this retrospective study. The prostate and seminal vesicles were contoured by a radiation oncologist on 2 cone beam computed tomography scans (CBCT) for each fraction, the initial CBCT at the start of the treatment session, and the verification CBCT immediately before beam-on. In part 1 of the study, PTVs of different sizes were defined on the initial CBCT, and the geometric overlap with the clinical target volume (CTV) on the verification CBCT was used to determine the optimal OART margin. This was performed with and without a patient realignment shift by registering the verification CBCT to the initial CBCT. In part 2 of the study, the margins determined in part 1 were used for simulated Ethos OART treatments on all 65 fractions. The resultant coverage to the CTV on the verification CBCT, was compared with an image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) workflow with 7-mm margins. Results Part 1 of the study found, if a verification CBCT and shift is performed, a 4-mm margin on the prostate and 5 mm on the seminal vesicles resulted in 95% of the CTV covered by the PTV in >90% of fractions, and 98% of the CTV covered by the PTV in >80% of fractions. Part 2 of the study found when these margins were used in an Ethos OART workflow, they resulted in CTV coverage that was superior to an IGRT workflow with 7-mm margins.

The program was delivered in 6-week terms. Seven graduates from diverse backgrounds were interviewed about their experiences with the course and its impact on their practice, confidence, professional identity, views on mental health service users, and their motivation for additional learning. The interviews were recorded and transcribed and underwent thematic content analysis. The graduates reported an increase in confidence and knowledge after completing the course, which led to a change in their views and attitudes towards service users. They appreciated the examination of psychotherapies and motivational interviewing, and applied their newly acquired skills and knowledge in their practice. The course was found to have improved their clinical practice. This study highlights a departure from traditional pedagogical approaches in mental health skill acquisition, as the entire program was delivered online. There is a need for further research to determine who might benefit most from this mode of delivery and to verify the competencies acquired by graduates in real-world situations. Online mental health courses are a feasible option and have been positively received by graduates. To enable graduates to participate in transforming mental health services, systemic change and recognition of their capabilities, particularly those from non-traditional backgrounds, is required.

Additionally, we performed Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry for IL-33 in lung tissue to assess protein levels. <b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> Across the bulk RNA-sequencing datasets, <i>IL-33</i> gene expression and its signaling pathway were significantly lower in current versus former or never-smokers and increased upon smoking cessation (<i>P</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05).

However, faulty data in practice are still rare because of the \"safety oriented principle\". For this purpose, fault injection is regularly employed. Due to the stochastic nature of faults in the system, random fault injection can more realistically simulate faulty scenarios compared to the deterministic fault injection. The traditional method entails analyzing a significant amount of raw data to extract the fault distribution function, followed by random sampling. However, the obstacles lie in the scarcity of raw fault data and the labor-intensive nature of constructing the fault distribution function. This paper proposes a layered random fault injection method based on multiple Markov chains. First, a multi-layer structured fault model base is established for the system, followed by the implementation of layered fault injection. Then, the random fault types and degrees are realized using Markov chains, in which the fault probability function is determined by the state transition matrix. Subsequently, a low-complexity Alias sampling algorithm is proposed for discrete random sampling. The nominal model is transformed into a corresponding fault model based on the sampling outcomes, facilitating the acquisition of fault data.

The activation of epithelial-mesenchymal trophic units (EMTUs) regulated by airway epithelial cells (AECs) has been proven to induce airway remodeling directly. However, the triggers for EMTU activation and the underlying mechanism of airway remodeling are not fully elucidated. Here, we screened the differentially expressed gene cathepsin C (CTSC; also known as dipeptidyl peptidase 1 [DPP-1]) in epithelia of patients with SA and UA using RNA-sequencing data and further verified the increased expression of CTSC in induced sputum of patients with asthma, which was positively correlated with severity and airway remodeling. Moreover, direct instillation of exogenous CTSC induced airway remodeling. Genetic inhibition of CTSC suppressed EMTU activation and airway remodeling in two asthma models with airway remodeling. Mechanistically, increased secretion of CTSC from AECs induced EMTU activation through the p38-mediated pathway, further inducing airway remodeling. Meanwhile, inhibition of CTSC also reduced the infiltration of inflammatory cells and the production of inflammatory factors in the lungs of asthmatic mice. Consequently, targeting CTSC with compound AZD7986 protected against airway inflammation, EMTU activation, and remodeling in the asthma model.

During the course of this study, a simplified embryo grading system was developed for both in vivo- and in vitro-derived embryos that proved to be significantly associated with both embryo metabolism and survival rates following transfer into a recipient mare. A total of 15 in vivo derived embryos and 32 ICSI-derived embryos were cultured in protein free synthetic oviduct fluid (SOF) for 24h between day 8 and day 9 of development. Aliquots of 10\u00b5L of media before culture (t=0) and spent media after culture (t=24h) were snap frozen for subsequent analysis by GC-Mass Spectrometry for glucose, lactate and pyruvate. The embryos were photographed and classified as grade 1, 2 or 3 based on the percentage of extruded debris between the trophoblast and the zona pellucida. In this study the sex of the embryos (in vivo n\u202f=\u202f5, ICSI n\u202f=\u202f25) was determined by PCR. At day 8 of development, the embryo metabolism of glucose, pyruvate and lactate in relation to embryo origin (in vivo vs in vitro), grade and sex wasevaluated following 24h of culture in protein free media. Overall, there was a positive correlation between embryo volume and lactate peak area (r2\u202f=\u202f88.2%, p \u2264 0.001) and a negative correlation with both glucose peak area (r2\u202f=\u202f29.8%, p =0.023) and pyruvate peak area (r2\u202f=\u202f46.2%, p =0.003) in the spent media. These results illustrated that as embryo volume increased, the amount of glucose and pyruvate in the media decreased and the production of lactate increased. After accounting for embryo volume, general linear model analysis revealed an effect of embryo grade (p =0.031), but no significant effect of embryo sex or origin on lactate consumption over 24h. Grade 2 embryos, however, consumed more lactate than Grade 1 embryos (p\u202f=\u202f0.029). In conclusion, the metabolic relationships between glucose, lactate and pyruvate were described for both in vivo- and in vitro-derived equine embryos in this study.

The bioconcentration factors between organic tissues and phytoliths of As and Cr (> 1) were significantly higher than those of Cd, Pb, Zn and Cu, and about 10\u00a0% and 40\u00a0% of the total As and Cr that bioaccumulated in wheat organic tissues were encapsulated into the corresponding phytoliths under high-level SiNP treatment. These observations demonstrate that the potential interaction of plant silica with TTMs is highly variable among elements, with As and Cr being the two most strongly concentrated TTMs in the phytoliths of wheat treated with SiNPs. The qualitative and semi-quantitative analyses of the phytoliths extracted from wheat tissues suggest that the high pore space and surface area (\u2248 200 m2 g\u22121) of phytolith particles could have contributed to the embedding of TTMs during silica gel polymerization and concentration to form PhytTTMs. The abundant SiO functional groups and high silicate-minerals in phytoliths are dominant chemical mechanisms for the preferential encapsulation of TTMs (i.e., As and Cr) by wheat phytoliths. Notably, the organic carbon and bioavailable Si of soils and the translocation of minerals from soil to plant aerial parts can impact TTM sequestration by phytoliths. Thus, this study has implications for the distribution or detoxification of TTMs in plants via preferential PhytTTM production and biogeochemical cycling of PhytTTMs in contaminated cropland following exogenous Si supplementation.\n               ", "source": "elsevier"}, {"Publication_ID": 589024, "title": "A substantial number of patients with rest pain, ulceration or gangrene are unable to undergo current non\u2010invasive perfusion testing\u2014Could another modality be utilised?", "doi": "10.1111/WRR.13138", "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Rest pain, ulceration and gangrene are hallmark features of chronic limb\u2010threatening ischaemia (CLTI).

Despite using intensive chemotherapy and allogeneic stem cell transplantation, the treatment options for AML remain open for innovation. Thus, there is a need to explore alternative therapies such as less toxic targeted therapies in AML. Aurora A kinase is a well-established target for the treatment of various cancers, including AML. This kinase plays a pivotal role in the cell-division cycle, particularly in different stages of mitosis, and is also involved in many other cellular regulatory processes. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the anti-viral drug rilpivirine is an Aurora A kinase inhibitor. In the current study, we have further explored the selectivity of rilpivirine for Aurora A kinase inhibition by testing this drug against a panel of 429 kinases. Concurrently, we demonstrated that rilpivirine significantly inhibited the proliferation of AML cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner that was preceded by G2/M cell-cycle arrest leading to the induction of apoptosis. Consistent with its kinase inhibitory role, rilpivirine modulated the expression of critical proteins in the Aurora A kinase-signalling pathway. Importantly, orally administered rilpivirine significantly inhibited tumour growth in an HL-60 xenograft model without showing body weight changes or other clinical signs of toxicity. Furthermore, rilpivirine enhanced the anti-proliferative efficacy of the conventional anti-leukaemic chemotherapeutic agent cytarabine.

Tranexamic acid (TXA), an antifibrinolytic agent, can reduce bleeding in traumatic injuries and potentially enhance outcomes. Previous reviews suggested potential TXA benefits but did not consider the latest trials. Methods A systematic review and bias-adjusted meta-analysis were performed to assess TXA\u2019s effectiveness in emergency traumatic injury settings by pooling estimates from randomized controlled trials. Researchers searched Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central for randomized controlled trials comparing TXA\u2019s effects to a placebo in emergency trauma cases. The primary endpoint was 1-month mortality. The methodological quality of the trials underwent assessment using the MASTER scale, and the meta-analysis applied the quality-effects method to adjust for methodological quality. Results Seven randomized controlled trials met the set criteria. This meta-analysis indicated an 11% decrease in the death risk at 1 month after TXA use (odds ratio [OR] 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84 to 0.95) with a number needed to treat of 61 to avoid 1 additional death. The meta-analysis also revealed reduced 24-hour mortality (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.88) for TXA. No compelling evidence of increased vascular occlusive events emerged (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.27). Subgroup analyses highlighted TXA\u2019s effectiveness in general trauma versus traumatic brain injury and survival advantages when administered out-of-hospital versus inhospital. Conclusions This synthesis demonstrates that TXA use for trauma in emergencies leads to a reduction in 1-month mortality, with no significant evidence of problematic vascular occlusive events. Administering TXA in the out-of-hospital setting is associated with reduced mortality compared to inhospital administration, and less mortality with TXA in systemic trauma is noted compared with traumatic brain injury specifically.", "source": "elsevier"}, {"Publication_ID": 612025, "title": "Perceptions of Cambodian mothers about fermented foods in gastrointestinal health context", "doi": NaN}, {"Publication_ID": 602039, "title": "Antivenoms for local effects of snake envenoming&amp;nbsp;", "doi": "10.4038/CJS.V52I3.8209", "abstract": "<jats:p>Snake envenoming is a significant public health issue that disproportionately affects the poorest communities in the tropical regions. There is a spectrum of local effects following snakebite, including pain, swelling, bluish discolouration, haemorrhagic blistering, local tissue necrosis and gangrene at the bite site. In severe local envenomings, significant tissue loss and impaired function can occur and may result in permanent disability in snakebite survivors. Although the mainstay of hospital treatment for snake envenoming is antivenom, its effectiveness for local effects remains contentious. \u00a0The preclinical efficacy of antivenoms against the local effects of envenoming is examined with a range of in-vivo and in-vitro tests. Most of these tests are only capable of examining the ability of the antivenom to prevent, rather than reverse, the local effect. A limitation of the above tests is that they do not consider venom pharmacokinetics or the time course of irreversible effects in envenomed humans. Therefore, more clinically relevant experimental models of antivenom efficacy are required. We searched MEDLINE for studies on the local effects of snakebite. The current clinical literature on the effectiveness of antivenom for local effects appears to be limited. We identified only two randomised trials that compared antivenom with placebo and six randomised trials that tested the effectiveness of one antivenom or one dosage regimen of an antivenom compared to another antivenom or different dosage of antivenom for preventing or reversing the local effects. All these studies were on viperine envenomings. In addition, several studies without a control/comparative group have commented on antivenom effectiveness, although they invariably have significant bias. The existing studies had contrasting conclusions, including no effect of antivenom, antivenom halting the progression of local effects, early antivenom preventing the occurrence of severe local effects including necrosis, early antivenom leading to faster functional improvement, antivenom accelerating the resolution of local effects, or no conclusion.

However, analysis of the engineered strain of <i>E. coli</i> using semitargeted liquid chromatography with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS) and thiol derivatization revealed the presence of 15 additional microcystin analogues, including four linear peptide variants and, in total, 12 variants with modifications to the Adda moiety. Four of the Adda-variants lacked the phenyl group at the Adda-terminus, a modification that has not previously been reported in cyanobacteria. Their HRMS/MS spectra contained the product-ion from Adda at <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> 135.1168, but the commonly observed product-ion at <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> 135.0804 from Adda-containing microcystins was almost completely absent.

However, instead of the product-ion at <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> 135.1168, these three variants gave product-ions at <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> 121.1011. These observations, together with spectra from microcystin standards using in-source fragmentation, showed that the product-ion at <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> 135.1168 found in the HRMS/MS spectra of most microcystins originated from the C-2 to C-8 region of the Adda moiety.

By using a human-relevant large animal model, the domestic boar, this study focuses on furthering our understanding of the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in sperm capacitation. The UPS is a universal, evolutionarily conserved, cellular proteome-wide degradation and recycling machinery, that has been shown to play a significant role in reproduction during the past two decades. Herein, we have used a bottom-up proteomic approach to (i) monitor the capacitation-related changes in the sperm protein levels, and (ii) identify the targets of UPS regulation during sperm capacitation. Spermatozoa were capacitated under proteasomal activity-permissive and inhibiting conditions and extracted sperm proteins were subjected to high-resolution mass spectrometry. We report that 401 individual proteins differed at least two-fold in abundance (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) after in vitro capacitation (IVC) and 13 proteins were found significantly different (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) between capacitated spermatozoa with proteasomal inhibition compared to the vehicle control. These proteins were associated with biological processes including sperm capacitation, sperm motility, metabolism, binding to zona pellucida, and proteasome-mediated catabolism. Changes in RAB2A, CFAP161, and TTR during IVC were phenotyped by immunocytochemistry, image-based flow cytometry, and Western blotting. We conclude that (i) the sperm proteome is subjected to extensive remodeling during sperm capacitation, and (ii) the UPS has a narrow range of distinct protein substrates during capacitation. This knowledge highlights the importance of the UPS in sperm capacitation and offers opportunities to identify novel pharmacological targets to modulate sperm fertilizing ability for the benefit of human reproductive health, assisted reproductive therapy, and contraception, as well as reproductive management in food animal agriculture.", "pmid": "39215164", "source": "pubmed"}, {"Publication_ID": 578242, "title": "Figure S2: The total follow-up period (time from diagnosis to end of the study) of articles included in this review, sorted by end of the study period. from A Review of the Application of Spatial Survival Methods in Cancer Research: Trends, Modeling, and Visualization Techniques", "doi": "10.1158/1055-9965.23516009.V1", "abstract": "<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;Supplementary Figure S2 shows article's study period in years&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>", "source": "crossref"}, {"Publication_ID": 574122, "title": "Examining Whether Loss of Consciousness Is Associated With Worse Performance on the SCAT5 and Slower Clinical Recovery After Concussion in Professional Athletes.", "doi": "10.1089/NEU.2022.0043", "abstract": "Video surveillance has almost universally been employed by professional sports to identify signs of concussion during competition.

Methods A final sample of 93 refugee participants (48 with DSM-5 PTSD or sub-syndromal PTSD and 45 matched trauma-exposed controls) completed a 5-minute resting state fMRI scan to enable the observation of connectivity in the DMN and other core networks. A self-construal index was calculated by substracting scores on the collectivistic and individualistic sub-scales of the Self Construal Scale. Results Independent components analysis identified 9 active networks-of-interest, and functional network connectivity was determined. A significant interaction effect between PTSD and self-construal index was observed in the anterior ventromedial DMN, with spatial maps localizing this to the left ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), extending to the ventral anterior cingulate cortex. This effect revealed that connectivity in the vMPFC showed greater reductions in those with PTSD with higher levels of collectivistic self-construal. Limitations This is an observational study and causality cannot be assumed. The specialized sample of refugees means that the findings may not generalize to other trauma-exposed populations. Conclusions Such a finding indicates that self-construal may shape the core neural architecture of PTSD, given that functional disruptions to the vmPFC underpin the core mechanisms of extinction learning, emotion dysregulation and self-referential processing in PTSD. Results have important implications for understanding the universality of neural disturbances in PTSD, and suggest that self-construal could be an important consideration in the assessment and treatment of post-traumatic stress reactions.", "source": "elsevier"}, {"Publication_ID": 576035, "title": "A mixed methods evaluation of Quit for new life, a smoking cessation initiative for women having an Aboriginal baby", "doi": "10.1186/S12913-023-09496-3", "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Background</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Quit for new life (QFNL) is a smoking cessation initiative developed to support mothers of Aboriginal babies to quit smoking during pregnancy.

Notably, children diagnosed with autism and ADHD did not follow this pattern; instead, they exhibited more similarities to NT children. The reduced amplitudes of phonetically elicited MMN in children with autism and reduced P3b in children with ADHD suggest that the two respective ERPs can act as potential biomarkers for each condition.

Here, we found that protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) expression was inversely correlated with the number and activity of CD8+ T cells within melanoma specimen. PRMT1 deficiency or inhibition with DCPT1061 significantly restrained refractory melanoma growth and increased intratumoral CD8+ T cells in vivo. Moreover, PRMT1 deletion in melanoma cells facilitated formation of double-stranded RNA derived from endogenous retroviral elements (ERV) and stimulated an intracellular interferon response. Mechanistically, PRMT1 deficiency repressed the expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) by attenuating modification of H4R3me2a and H3K27ac at enhancer regions of Dnmt1, and DNMT1 downregulation consequently activated ERV transcription and the interferon signaling. Importantly, PRMT1 inhibition with DCPT1061 synergized with PD-1 blockade to suppress tumor progression and increase the proportion of CD8+ T cells as well as IFN\u03b3+CD8+ T cells in vivo.

AMPK is implicated in several diseases including but not limited to diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. Regulation of AMPK is cogent for restoring cellular energy levels which mediates the pathways leading to these diseases. Allosteric activation of AMPK via a novel ADaM site is intended for study in this case. In the search for AMPK activators, this study engaged a database for a virtual screening campaign through the ZINC15 database involving pharmacophoric modeling of two reported natural bioactive AMPK activators- Galegine and Epigallocatechin. Generated pharmacophores were targeted against the AMPK-ADaM site by employing various tools within the structure-based drug discovery process among which include consensus molecular docking, physicochemical profiling, ADMET, and molecular dynamics simulation. Advanced methods such as molecular mechanics (MM/GBSA) and quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) were also performed. This investigation revealed promising pharmacophores that show better interactions and pharmacokinetic properties compared to the standards. This study proposes further development of these pharmacophores into potential drugs with better efficacies that could enhance the activation of the AMPK-ADaM site in ameliorating the aforementioned diseases.", "pmid": "39896884", "source": "pubmed"}, {"Publication_ID": 616235, "title": "Biceps femoris long head muscle and aponeurosis geometry in males with and without a history of hamstring strain injury", "doi": "10.1111/SMS.14619", "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:sec><jats:title>Objectives</jats:title><jats:p>Hamstring strain injuries (HSIs) commonly affect the proximal biceps femoris long head (BFlh) musculotendinous junction.

Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the dimensionality of dietary data. Cardiometabolic risk was quantified using the metabolic syndrome severity score (MetSSS). Tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) were used to derive composite scores on four cognitive domains: processing speed, executive function, short-term memory, and long-term memory. Results: Three dietary patterns were identified using PCA: a plant-dominant diet, a Western-style diet, and a meat-dominant diet. After controlling for age, sex, total years of education, energy intake, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), there was a small, negative association between the meat-dominant diets and long-term memory. Subsequent moderation analysis indicated that MetSSS significantly moderated this relationship. Conclusions: Findings highlight the link between diet, cardiometabolic health, and cognitive function in older, cognitively healthy adults. However, longitudinal studies are needed to confirm observations and evaluate the dynamics of diet, cardiometabolic health, and cognitive function over time.</jats:p>", "source": "crossref"}, {"Publication_ID": 599759, "title": "An integrative review of the impact of allied health student placements on current staff\u2019s knowledge and procedural skills in acute and primary care settings", "doi": "10.1186/S12909-024-05632-7", "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Background</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Staff shortages limit access to health services. The bidirectional benefits of allied health clinical placements are understood in the domains of student learning, health service delivery, and future workforce development. Still, the benefits to current workforce outcomes remain unknown. This review provides insights into the effects of allied health student placements in acute and primary care settings, particularly on healthcare staff's knowledge and procedural skills.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>This search was based on the integrative review process established by Whittemore and Knafl in 2005.

The systematic search yielded 12 papers on allied health student placements across various healthcare settings in rural and metropolitan areas, with no high-quality methodologies measuring student placements' impact on staff knowledge and skills. Four main themes were identified from the analysis: meaningful student integration in service delivery, targeted educational support to healthcare staff, development of staff procedural skills and confidence, and the mechanisms of why student placements work in this aspect.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>This review suggests that offering allied health student placement could be a promising approach to supporting rural healthcare staff in performing patient assessments and treatments proficiently and collaboratively.

We identified the organizational factors associated with their confidence in pandemic response and proposed potential management levers to guide primary care response for the pandemic. We conducted a cross-sectional survey with 224 PCPs working in 38 community health centers in China. Guided by self-efficacy theory, organization-level factors (organizational structure and organizational culture) and physician-level factors (job skill variety, perceived organizational support, work-family conflict, and professional fulfillment) were selected, and two-level ordinal logit models were built to examine their association with PCPs\u2019 confidence in pandemic response.
