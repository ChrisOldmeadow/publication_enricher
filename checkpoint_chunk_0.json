Approximately 50% of people with diabetes and a foot ulcer have peripheral artery disease (PAD) and the presence of PAD significantly increases the risk of adverse limb and cardiovascular events. The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) has published evidence based guidelines on the management and prevention of diabetes related foot complications since 1999. This guideline is an update of the 2019 IWGDF guideline on the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of peripheral artery disease in people with diabetes mellitus and a foot ulcer. For this updated guideline, the IWGDF, the European Society for Vascular Surgery, and the Society for Vascular Surgery decided to collaborate to develop a consistent suite of recommendations relevant to clinicians in all countries. This guideline is based on three new systematic reviews. Using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework clinically relevant questions were formulated, and the literature was systematically reviewed. After assessing the certainty of the evidence, recommendations were formulated which were weighed against the balance of benefits and harms, patient values, feasibility, acceptability, equity, resources required, and when available, costs. Through this process five recommendations were developed for diagnosing PAD in a person with diabetes, with and without a foot ulcer or gangrene. Five recommendations were developed for prognosis relating to estimating likelihood of healing and amputation outcomes in a person with diabetes and a foot ulcer or gangrene. Fifteen recommendations were developed related to PAD treatment encompassing prioritisation of people for revascularisation, the choice of a procedure and post-surgical care. In addition, the Writing Committee has highlighted key research questions where current evidence is lacking.

To provide a current and rigorous review, peer-reviewed articles between 2009 and 2021 published in English were searched across three databases: ScienceDirect, PubMed and Ovid/Medline.

There is reasonable evidence to support prevention programs reducing risk factors, particularly as part of school or university-based programs, with established feasibility and relatively high acceptance among students.

Clopidogrel exerts its antiplatelet activity via antagonism of the P2Y12 receptor (P2RY12). Although not widely known or considered during the initial clinical trials for clopidogrel, P2RY12 is also expressed on microglia, which are the brain\u2019s immune cells, where the receptor facilitates chemotactic migration toward sites of cellular damage. If microglial P2RY12 is blocked, microglia lose the ability to migrate to damaged sites and carry out essential repair processes. We aimed to investigate whether administering clopidogrel to mice post-stroke was associated with (i) impaired motor skills and cognitive recovery; (ii) physiological changes, such as survival rate and body weight; (iii) changes in the neurovascular unit, including blood vessels, microglia, and neurons; and (iv) changes in immune cells. Photothrombotic stroke (or sham surgery) was induced in adult male mice. From 24 h post-stroke, mice were treated daily for 14 days with either clopidogrel or a control. Cognitive performance (memory and learning) was assessed using a mouse touchscreen platform (paired associated learning task), while motor impairment was assessed using the cylinder task for paw asymmetry. On day 15, the mice were euthanized and their brains were collected for immunohistochemistry analysis. Clopidogrel administration significantly impaired learning and memory recovery, reduced mouse survival rates, and reduced body weight post-stroke. Furthermore, clopidogrel significantly increased vascular leakage, significantly increased the number and appearance of microglia, and significantly reduced the number of T cells within the peri-infarct region post-stroke. These data suggest that clopidogrel hampers cognitive performance post-stroke. This effect is potentially mediated by an increase in vascular permeability post-stroke, providing a pathway for clopidogrel to access the central nervous system, and thus, interfere in repair and recovery processes.</jats:p>", "source": "crossref", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Marina Paul", "Jonathan W.

Out of 12,626 studies identified, 40 used machine learning for ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke risk prediction models. Synthesis without meta-analysis identified that a boosting algorithm (median C-statistics = 0.9 (interquartile range [IQR]: 0.88-0.92)), and neural network (median C-statistic = 0.80 (IQR: 0.77-0.92)) performed best among ML models in the low risk of bias studies. Moreover, a boosting algorithm also performed best in overall (both low and high risk of bias) studies (median C-statistic = 0.92 (IQR: 0.90-0.95)). Conclusions: The systematic review found promising results of the ML algorithm model performances compare with the gold standard conventional models, such as FSRP (C-statistic 0.653) and revised FSRP (C-statistic 0.716). In term of the algorithm, boosting and neural networks are robust, but are considered as black-box models, since they are composed of non-linearity and complex algorithms. It remains questionable whether a physician would adapt these algorithms to use in a real clinical setting. Moreover, less than half of the studies (16 out of 40) were at low risk of bias in our systematic review. More researches with good methodology and study design, alongside explainable and good performance models, may become available in the future.</jats:p>", "source": "crossref", "match_info": {"fuzzy_matched": false, "query_doi": "10.1101/2024.03.28.24305014", "match_type": "doi"}}, {"Publication_ID": 602232, "title": "Healthcare Professional Perspectives on the Impact of the Physical Health Nurse Consultant", "doi": "10.1111/INM.13399", "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Early mortality experienced by people living with mental health issues (hereon termed consumers) is largely preventable.

Subsequent experiments revealed that NIPSNAP1 promotes cancer cell proliferation and inhibits P27-dependent induction of senescence via dual mechanisms. Firstly, NIPSNAP1 maintains the levels of c-Myc by sequestering the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXL14 to prevent the proteasome-mediated turnover of c-Myc. Intriguingly, NIPSNAP1 levels are restrained by transcriptional repression mediated by c-Myc-Miz1, with repression lifted in response to serum withdrawal, thus identifying feedback regulation between NIPSNAP1 and c-Myc. Secondly, NIPSNAP1 was shown to modulate ROS levels by promoting interactions between the deacetylase SIRT3 and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2). Consequent activation of SOD2 serves to maintain cellular ROS levels below the critical levels required to induce cell cycle arrest and senescence. Importantly, the actions of NIPSNAP1 in promoting cancer cell proliferation and preventing senescence were recapitulated in vivo using xenograft models.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Together, these findings reveal NIPSNAP1 as an important mediator of c-Myc function and a negative regulator of cellular senescence.

We used a Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold and tested robustness of the results with teacher assessments of behavior and a second PGS.

Adaptive trials are needed to accelerate the conduct of more efficient, informative, and ethical clinical research in the field of neurology as compared to traditional fixed designs. Stroke is a natural candidate for adoption of these innovative approaches to trial design. This Research Methods in Neurology paper is informed by scoping review that identified 45 completed and ongoing adaptive clinical trials in stroke that were appraised: 14 trials had published results with or without a published protocol, 15 trials had a published protocol, and 16 trials were registered only. Treatments spanned acute (n=28), rehabilitation (n=8), prevention (n=8), and rehabilitation and prevention (n=1) domains. A subsample of these trials were selected to illustrate the utility of adaptive design features and discuss why each adaptive feature(s) were incorporated in the design to best achieve the aim, whether each individual feature was used and if it resulted in expected efficiencies, and any learnings during preparation, conduct or reporting. We then discuss the operational, ethical, and regulatory considerations that warrant careful consideration during adaptive trial planning and reflect on the workforce readiness to deliver adaptive trials in practice. We conclude that adaptive trials can be designed, funded, conducted, and published for a wide range of research questions and offer future directions to support adoption of adaptive trial designs in stroke and neurological research more broadly.</jats:p>", "source": "crossref", "year": 2024, "authors": ["Kathryn S Hayward", "Emily J Dalton", "Bruce CV Campbell", "Pooja Khatri", "Sean P Dukelow", "Hannah Johns", "Silke Walter", "Vignan Yogendrakumar", "Jeyaraj Pandian", "Simona Sacco", "Julie Bernhardt", "Mark Parsons", "Jeffrey L Saver", "Leonid Churilov"], "match_info": {"fuzzy_matched": true, "query_title": "Adaptive Trials in Stroke: Current Use and Future Directions", "matched_title": "Adaptive trials in stroke: Current use &amp; future directions", "match_score": 100, "base_score": 100, "author_bonus": 0, "match_type": "token_set_ratio", "threshold": 85}}, {"Publication_ID": 600140, "title": "Real\u2010world biologics response and super\u2010response in the International Severe Asthma Registry cohort", "doi": "10.1111/ALL.16178", "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:sec><jats:title>Background</jats:title><jats:p>Biologic asthma therapies reduce exacerbations and long\u2010term oral corticosteroids (LTOCS) use in randomized controlled trials (RCTs); however, there are limited data on outcomes among patients ineligible for RCTs.

Methods: The eligibility of DASL-HiCaP differed from ENZARAD by excluding patients solely based on PSA &gt; 20ng/mL and also allowing a very-high risk patient population suitable for salvage radiation post prostatectomy. Participants in DASL-HiCaP were randomized 1:1 to darolutamide 600mg twice daily or placebo plus LHRHA for 96 weeks; all received external beam radiotherapy including mandated pelvic radiation. Participants in ENZARAD were randomized 1:1 to enzalutamide 160mg daily for 24 months or conventional NSAA for 6 months, plus LHRHA for 24 months, and EBRT. Brachytherapy boost was allowed in both trials and pelvic nodal radiation was at investigator\u2019s discretion in ENZARAD.

MFS events are based on conventional imaging with <jats:sup>99m</jats:sup>Tc bone scan and CT, and/or MRI. Lesions evident only on PSMA PET are not counted as MFS events. Results: The median age for both trials was 71-years. Complete baseline characteristics are summarised in the Table. ENZARAD randomized 802 participants across 8 countries. Half had Gleason score 9 (52%), 45% had cT3 PCa, 42% had cT2, and 11% were cN1. Gleason score 7 was present in up to 11% of ENZARAD population. DASL-HiCaP randomized 1,107 participants across 6 countries. Most had Gleason score 9 (69%), 41% had cT3 PCa, 32% had cT2, and 28% were cN1. Gleason score 7 was present in &lt;5% of the DASL-HiCaP population. Conclusions: ENZARAD and DASL-HiCaP will define the efficacy of more potent hormonal therapy in the adjuvant setting of patients with both high- and very-high-risk disease and in both primary and salvage radiation settings.

Methods: Objectives: To synthesise evidence and debates on current and potential alcohol and tobacco taxation options for the UK, and report on the underlying objectives, evidence of effects and mediating factors. Eligibility criteria: Peer-reviewed and grey literature; published 1997\u20132018; English language; UK-focused; include taxation interventions for alcohol, tobacco, or both. Sources of evidence: PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Google, stakeholder and colleague recommendations. Charting methods: Excel spreadsheet structured using PICO framework, recording source characteristics and content. Results: Ninety-one sources qualified for inclusion: 49 alcohol, 36 tobacco, 6 both. Analysis identified four policy themes: changes to excise duty within existing tax structures, structural reforms, industry measures, and hypothecation of tax revenue for public benefits. For alcohol, policy options focused on raising the price of cheap, high-strength alcohol. For tobacco, policy options focused on raising the price of all tobacco products, especially the cheapest products, which are hand-rolling tobacco. For alcohol and tobacco, there were options such as levies that take money from the industries to help reduce the societal costs of their products. Due to the perceived social and economic importance of alcohol in contrast to tobacco, policy options also discussed supporting pubs and small breweries.

The excited electrons of these FQDs are withdrawn by fluorine ions with high electronegativity, thereby inhibiting photoluminescence emission. FQDs are used for the detection of Fe2+, Fe3+, and Hg2+ ions through photoluminescence (PL) quenching, and the excited electrons are transferred between the F-doped QDs and these transition metal ions, reducing the PL emission.
