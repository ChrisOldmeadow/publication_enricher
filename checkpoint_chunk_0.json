There is an opportunity to better utilise the nurse role within the primary care team to meet this increasing demand in the provision of care for people living with dementia. However, general practice nurses have limited knowledge in the provision of best-practice care for people living with dementia and their carer(s).

Methods: Mice were fed a HFD (or chow) in the absence/presence of e-vapour exposure (\u00b1nicotine) and serum inflammation, lipid levels, and microbial diversity were assessed. Results: HFD increased the circulating levels of both triglycerides and non-esterified fatty acids, which were significantly reduced by e-vapour exposure in HFD-fed mice. Serum TNF-\u03b1 was increased by HFD consumption or e-vapour. HFD had a significant effect on microbial diversity, but there were no additional effects of e-vapour exposure.

Clopidogrel exerts its antiplatelet activity via antagonism of the P2Y12 receptor (P2RY12). Although not widely known or considered during the initial clinical trials for clopidogrel, P2RY12 is also expressed on microglia, which are the brain\u2019s immune cells, where the receptor facilitates chemotactic migration toward sites of cellular damage. If microglial P2RY12 is blocked, microglia lose the ability to migrate to damaged sites and carry out essential repair processes. We aimed to investigate whether administering clopidogrel to mice post-stroke was associated with (i) impaired motor skills and cognitive recovery; (ii) physiological changes, such as survival rate and body weight; (iii) changes in the neurovascular unit, including blood vessels, microglia, and neurons; and (iv) changes in immune cells. Photothrombotic stroke (or sham surgery) was induced in adult male mice. From 24 h post-stroke, mice were treated daily for 14 days with either clopidogrel or a control. Cognitive performance (memory and learning) was assessed using a mouse touchscreen platform (paired associated learning task), while motor impairment was assessed using the cylinder task for paw asymmetry. On day 15, the mice were euthanized and their brains were collected for immunohistochemistry analysis. Clopidogrel administration significantly impaired learning and memory recovery, reduced mouse survival rates, and reduced body weight post-stroke. Furthermore, clopidogrel significantly increased vascular leakage, significantly increased the number and appearance of microglia, and significantly reduced the number of T cells within the peri-infarct region post-stroke. These data suggest that clopidogrel hampers cognitive performance post-stroke. This effect is potentially mediated by an increase in vascular permeability post-stroke, providing a pathway for clopidogrel to access the central nervous system, and thus, interfere in repair and recovery processes.</jats:p>", "source": "crossref", "year": 2023, "authors": ["Marina Paul", "Jonathan W.

There is growing evidence of the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms for stroke risk prediction models. Aims: A systematic review was conducted to identify and comprehensively evaluate the available evidence. Summary of review: Relevant studies were identified from the three electronic databases (i) MEDLINE via Pubmed, (ii) Scopus, and (iii) IEEE Xplore from inception to 1st December 2020. Out of 12,626 studies identified, 40 used machine learning for ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke risk prediction models. Synthesis without meta-analysis identified that a boosting algorithm (median C-statistics = 0.9 (interquartile range [IQR]: 0.88-0.92)), and neural network (median C-statistic = 0.80 (IQR: 0.77-0.92)) performed best among ML models in the low risk of bias studies. Moreover, a boosting algorithm also performed best in overall (both low and high risk of bias) studies (median C-statistic = 0.92 (IQR: 0.90-0.95)). Conclusions: The systematic review found promising results of the ML algorithm model performances compare with the gold standard conventional models, such as FSRP (C-statistic 0.653) and revised FSRP (C-statistic 0.716). In term of the algorithm, boosting and neural networks are robust, but are considered as black-box models, since they are composed of non-linearity and complex algorithms. It remains questionable whether a physician would adapt these algorithms to use in a real clinical setting. Moreover, less than half of the studies (16 out of 40) were at low risk of bias in our systematic review. More researches with good methodology and study design, alongside explainable and good performance models, may become available in the future.</jats:p>", "source": "crossref", "match_info": {"fuzzy_matched": false, "query_doi": "10.1101/2024.03.28.24305014", "match_type": "doi"}}, {"Publication_ID": 602232, "title": "Healthcare Professional Perspectives on the Impact of the Physical Health Nurse Consultant", "doi": "10.1111/INM.13399"}, {"Publication_ID": 612657, "title": "Managing breakthrough disease activity during treatment with natalizumab in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis", "doi": NaN}, {"Publication_ID": 573636, "title": "Short-term Adverse Events Following Immunization With Modified Vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian Nordic (MVA-BN) Vaccine for Mpox", "doi": "10.1001/jama.2023.7683", "abstract": "<jats:p>This study uses data collected by Australia\u2019s vaccine safety surveillance system to examine the adverse event profile of the modified vaccinia Ankara\u2013Bavarian Nordic vaccine.</jats:p>", "source": "crossref", "match_info": {"fuzzy_matched": false, "query_title": "Short-term Adverse Events Following Immunization With Modified Vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian Nordic (MVA-BN) Vaccine for Mpox", "matched_title": "Short-term Adverse Events Following Immunization With Modified Vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian Nordic (MVA-BN) Vaccine for Mpox", "match_type": "exact"}}, {"Publication_ID": 578486, "title": "An Overview of the Internet of Things (IoT) Applications in the Health Sector in Saudi Arabi", "doi": "10.1007/978-981-99-2233-8_40"}, {"Publication_ID": 612883, "title": "Fidelity of home-based pulmonary rehabilitation for COPD referred from general practice", "doi": NaN}, {"Publication_ID": 613072, "title": "Drug Repurposing in Cancer Care", "doi": NaN}, {"Publication_ID": 609944, "title": "Unpacking the (more accepted) role of the dental team in obesity", "doi": "10.1002/OBY.24171"}, {"Publication_ID": 578053, "title": "Involvement of oxidative stress in placental dysfunction, the pathophysiology of fetal death and pregnancy disorders", "doi": "10.1530/REP-22-0278", "abstract": "<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>In brief</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Placental oxidative stress contributes to both normal and abnormal placentation during pregnancy.

Abnormal placental function and immune disturbances are linked to many pregnancy-related disorders, including early and recurrent pregnancy loss, fetal death, spontaneous preterm birth, preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction. This review discusses the role of placental oxidative stress in both normal and pathological settings.

The impact of rurality on CVD outcomes needs to be fully elucidated. Objectives The purpose of this study was to assess the difference in mortality, readmission within 30 days, total readmissions, survival, and total emergency department (ED) presentations following an index CVD admission among patients from rural or remote areas as compared to metropolitan areas. Methods This retrospective observational study included all index hospitalizations with heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation (AF), or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) within the Hunter New England region of Australia, between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2021. Results There were 27,995 ACS admissions, 15,586 HF admissions, and 16,935 AF admissions. Patients from a rural or remote area presenting with CVD presentations had increased 30-day readmission (OR: 1.19; P < 0.001), an increased number of readmissions (incident rate ratio: 1.19; P < 0.001), and more ED presentations (incident rate ratio: 1.39; P < 0.001) as compared to patients from metropolitan areas. This was consistent across patients presenting with ACS, HF, and AF. There was no difference in mortality (HR: 1.01; P = 0.515). However, in the ACS subgroup, there was increased mortality in the rural and remote population (HR: 1.05; P = 0.015).

Subsequent experiments revealed that NIPSNAP1 promotes cancer cell proliferation and inhibits P27-dependent induction of senescence via dual mechanisms. Firstly, NIPSNAP1 maintains the levels of c-Myc by sequestering the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXL14 to prevent the proteasome-mediated turnover of c-Myc. Intriguingly, NIPSNAP1 levels are restrained by transcriptional repression mediated by c-Myc-Miz1, with repression lifted in response to serum withdrawal, thus identifying feedback regulation between NIPSNAP1 and c-Myc. Secondly, NIPSNAP1 was shown to modulate ROS levels by promoting interactions between the deacetylase SIRT3 and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2). Consequent activation of SOD2 serves to maintain cellular ROS levels below the critical levels required to induce cell cycle arrest and senescence. Importantly, the actions of NIPSNAP1 in promoting cancer cell proliferation and preventing senescence were recapitulated in vivo using xenograft models.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Together, these findings reveal NIPSNAP1 as an important mediator of c-Myc function and a negative regulator of cellular senescence.

Adaptive trials are needed to accelerate the conduct of more efficient, informative, and ethical clinical research in the field of neurology as compared to traditional fixed designs. Stroke is a natural candidate for adoption of these innovative approaches to trial design. This Research Methods in Neurology paper is informed by scoping review that identified 45 completed and ongoing adaptive clinical trials in stroke that were appraised: 14 trials had published results with or without a published protocol, 15 trials had a published protocol, and 16 trials were registered only. Treatments spanned acute (n=28), rehabilitation (n=8), prevention (n=8), and rehabilitation and prevention (n=1) domains. A subsample of these trials were selected to illustrate the utility of adaptive design features and discuss why each adaptive feature(s) were incorporated in the design to best achieve the aim, whether each individual feature was used and if it resulted in expected efficiencies, and any learnings during preparation, conduct or reporting. We then discuss the operational, ethical, and regulatory considerations that warrant careful consideration during adaptive trial planning and reflect on the workforce readiness to deliver adaptive trials in practice. We conclude that adaptive trials can be designed, funded, conducted, and published for a wide range of research questions and offer future directions to support adoption of adaptive trial designs in stroke and neurological research more broadly.</jats:p>", "source": "crossref", "year": 2024, "authors": ["Kathryn S Hayward", "Emily J Dalton", "Bruce CV Campbell", "Pooja Khatri", "Sean P Dukelow", "Hannah Johns", "Silke Walter", "Vignan Yogendrakumar", "Jeyaraj Pandian", "Simona Sacco", "Julie Bernhardt", "Mark Parsons", "Jeffrey L Saver", "Leonid Churilov"], "match_info": {"fuzzy_matched": true, "query_title": "Adaptive Trials in Stroke: Current Use and Future Directions", "matched_title": "Adaptive trials in stroke: Current use &amp; future directions", "match_score": 100, "base_score": 100, "author_bonus": 0, "match_type": "token_set_ratio", "threshold": 90}}, {"Publication_ID": 600140, "title": "Real\u2010world biologics response and super\u2010response in the International Severe Asthma Registry cohort", "doi": "10.1111/ALL.16178", "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:sec><jats:title>Background</jats:title><jats:p>Biologic asthma therapies reduce exacerbations and long\u2010term oral corticosteroids (LTOCS) use in randomized controlled trials (RCTs); however, there are limited data on outcomes among patients ineligible for RCTs.

International guidelines outline the standards of care for CVD risk surveillance and management. However, Australian cardio-oncology policies and clinical guidelines are limited. There is increasing growth of cardio-oncology research in Australia and support from leading Australian professional bodies and advocacy and research networks, including the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand, the Clinical Oncology Society of Australia, the National Heart Foundation of Australia, and the Australian Cardiovascular Alliance (ACvA). Thus, opportunities to drive multidisciplinary cardio-oncology initiatives are growing, including grant funding, position statements, and novel research to inform new policies. The ACvA has a unique flagship structure that spans the translational research pipeline from drug discovery to implementation science. This article aims to highlight how multidisciplinary cardio-oncology innovations could intersect with the seven ACvA flagships, and to showcase Australian achievements in cardio-oncology thus far. We summarise eight key priority areas for future cardio-oncology research that emerged.

Methods: The eligibility of DASL-HiCaP differed from ENZARAD by excluding patients solely based on PSA &gt; 20ng/mL and also allowing a very-high risk patient population suitable for salvage radiation post prostatectomy. Participants in DASL-HiCaP were randomized 1:1 to darolutamide 600mg twice daily or placebo plus LHRHA for 96 weeks; all received external beam radiotherapy including mandated pelvic radiation. Participants in ENZARAD were randomized 1:1 to enzalutamide 160mg daily for 24 months or conventional NSAA for 6 months, plus LHRHA for 24 months, and EBRT. Brachytherapy boost was allowed in both trials and pelvic nodal radiation was at investigator\u2019s discretion in ENZARAD. The primary end point for both trials is metastasis-free survival (MFS) (time from randomization to first evidence of metastasis or death from any cause). MFS events are based on conventional imaging with <jats:sup>99m</jats:sup>Tc bone scan and CT, and/or MRI. Lesions evident only on PSMA PET are not counted as MFS events. Results: The median age for both trials was 71-years. Complete baseline characteristics are summarised in the Table. ENZARAD randomized 802 participants across 8 countries. Half had Gleason score 9 (52%), 45% had cT3 PCa, 42% had cT2, and 11% were cN1. Gleason score 7 was present in up to 11% of ENZARAD population. DASL-HiCaP randomized 1,107 participants across 6 countries. Most had Gleason score 9 (69%), 41% had cT3 PCa, 32% had cT2, and 28% were cN1. Gleason score 7 was present in &lt;5% of the DASL-HiCaP population. Conclusions: ENZARAD and DASL-HiCaP will define the efficacy of more potent hormonal therapy in the adjuvant setting of patients with both high- and very-high-risk disease and in both primary and salvage radiation settings.

Methods: Objectives: To synthesise evidence and debates on current and potential alcohol and tobacco taxation options for the UK, and report on the underlying objectives, evidence of effects and mediating factors. Eligibility criteria: Peer-reviewed and grey literature; published 1997\u20132018; English language; UK-focused; include taxation interventions for alcohol, tobacco, or both. Sources of evidence: PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Google, stakeholder and colleague recommendations. Charting methods: Excel spreadsheet structured using PICO framework, recording source characteristics and content. Results: Ninety-one sources qualified for inclusion: 49 alcohol, 36 tobacco, 6 both. Analysis identified four policy themes: changes to excise duty within existing tax structures, structural reforms, industry measures, and hypothecation of tax revenue for public benefits. For alcohol, policy options focused on raising the price of cheap, high-strength alcohol. For tobacco, policy options focused on raising the price of all tobacco products, especially the cheapest products, which are hand-rolling tobacco. For alcohol and tobacco, there were options such as levies that take money from the industries to help reduce the societal costs of their products. Due to the perceived social and economic importance of alcohol in contrast to tobacco, policy options also discussed supporting pubs and small breweries. Conclusions: This review has identified a set of tax policy options for tobacco and alcohol, their objectives, evidence of effects and related mediating factors.
