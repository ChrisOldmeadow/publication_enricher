In this Review, we describe current MSC-based therapeutic strategies and outline the important factors that need to be considered when developing next-generation cell expansion platforms. To retain the functional value of expanded MSCs, ex vivo culture systems should ideally recapitulate the components of the native stem cell microenvironment, which include soluble cues, resident cells, and the extracellular matrix substrate. We review the interplay between these stem cell niche components and their biological roles in governing MSC phenotype and functionality.

Over the last few decades, As contamination has been augmented noticeably due to both natural and anthropogenic sources. Arsenic contamination in groundwater is currently a major global environmental catastrophe, which affects over 200 million people in 107 countries and causes various health complications including cancer. Therefore, updated information regarding the sources, chemical form, bioavailability, extent and severity, food safety and regulation, remediation, and management of As is essential. In this chapter, we accumulated the detailed sources of As, including point and diffuse sources, various inorganic and organic As species, and their toxicity in the environment. Moreover, the fate of As in the environment, economic implications of As-contaminated food and food products, and the bioavailability and bio-accessibility of As in environmental media are also briefly summarized.

Approximately 50% of people with diabetes and a foot ulcer have peripheral artery disease (PAD) and the presence of PAD significantly increases the risk of adverse limb and cardiovascular events. The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) has published evidence based guidelines on the management and prevention of diabetes related foot complications since 1999. This guideline is an update of the 2019 IWGDF guideline on the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of peripheral artery disease in people with diabetes mellitus and a foot ulcer. For this updated guideline, the IWGDF, the European Society for Vascular Surgery, and the Society for Vascular Surgery decided to collaborate to develop a consistent suite of recommendations relevant to clinicians in all countries. This guideline is based on three new systematic reviews. Using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework clinically relevant questions were formulated, and the literature was systematically reviewed. After assessing the certainty of the evidence, recommendations were formulated which were weighed against the balance of benefits and harms, patient values, feasibility, acceptability, equity, resources required, and when available, costs. Through this process five recommendations were developed for diagnosing PAD in a person with diabetes, with and without a foot ulcer or gangrene. Five recommendations were developed for prognosis relating to estimating likelihood of healing and amputation outcomes in a person with diabetes and a foot ulcer or gangrene. Fifteen recommendations were developed related to PAD treatment encompassing prioritisation of people for revascularisation, the choice of a procedure and post-surgical care. In addition, the Writing Committee has highlighted key research questions where current evidence is lacking. The Writing Committee believes that following these recommendations will help healthcare professionals to provide better care and will reduce the burden of diabetes related foot complications.", "source": "elsevier"}, {"Publication_ID": 575141, "title": "Cross-sectional associations between 24-hour time-use composition, grey matter volume and cognitive function in healthy older adults", "doi": "10.1101/2023.05.15.23289982", "abstract": "<jats:sec><jats:title>Background</jats:title><jats:p>Increasing physical activity (PA) is an effective strategy to slow reductions in cortical volume and maintain cognitive function in older adulthood.

Originating in the brain stem, it serves as a link between the higher brain centers, autonomic nervous system, central and peripheral nervous systems, immune system, and visceral organs through extensive branching and afferent/efferent innervation. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has proven effective in treating refractory epilepsy and treatment-resistant depression, while also showing promise in managing chronic pain. Its potential analgesic effects have been demonstrated in animals, with comparable effects documented in epilepsy patients with implanted VNS devices. Further support comes from experimental pain studies in healthy humans and neuroimaging studies.

One of the most targeted risk factors, body dissatisfaction, is found in girls as young as 6\u00a0years old, indicating a need for further research implementing prevention initiatives at younger ages. Follow-up research is limited; thus, the long-term efficacy and effectiveness of studied programs is unknown.

Clopidogrel exerts its antiplatelet activity via antagonism of the P2Y12 receptor (P2RY12). Although not widely known or considered during the initial clinical trials for clopidogrel, P2RY12 is also expressed on microglia, which are the brain\u2019s immune cells, where the receptor facilitates chemotactic migration toward sites of cellular damage. If microglial P2RY12 is blocked, microglia lose the ability to migrate to damaged sites and carry out essential repair processes. We aimed to investigate whether administering clopidogrel to mice post-stroke was associated with (i) impaired motor skills and cognitive recovery; (ii) physiological changes, such as survival rate and body weight; (iii) changes in the neurovascular unit, including blood vessels, microglia, and neurons; and (iv) changes in immune cells. Photothrombotic stroke (or sham surgery) was induced in adult male mice. From 24 h post-stroke, mice were treated daily for 14 days with either clopidogrel or a control. Cognitive performance (memory and learning) was assessed using a mouse touchscreen platform (paired associated learning task), while motor impairment was assessed using the cylinder task for paw asymmetry. On day 15, the mice were euthanized and their brains were collected for immunohistochemistry analysis. Clopidogrel administration significantly impaired learning and memory recovery, reduced mouse survival rates, and reduced body weight post-stroke. Furthermore, clopidogrel significantly increased vascular leakage, significantly increased the number and appearance of microglia, and significantly reduced the number of T cells within the peri-infarct region post-stroke. These data suggest that clopidogrel hampers cognitive performance post-stroke. This effect is potentially mediated by an increase in vascular permeability post-stroke, providing a pathway for clopidogrel to access the central nervous system, and thus, interfere in repair and recovery processes.</jats:p>", "source": "crossref", "match_info": {"fuzzy_matched": true, "query_title": "Clopidogrel Administration Impairs Post-Stoke Learning and Memory Recovery in Mice", "matched_title": "Clopidogrel Administration Impairs Post-Stroke Learning and Memory Recovery in Mice", "match_score": 99, "match_type": "token_set_ratio", "threshold": 90}}, {"Publication_ID": 582281, "title": "The Patient\u2010Determined Disease Steps scale is not interchangeable with the Expanded Disease Status Scale in mild to moderate multiple sclerosis", "doi": "10.1111/ENE.16046", "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:sec><jats:title>Background and purpose</jats:title><jats:p>The validity, reliability, and longitudinal performance of the Patient\u2010Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) scale is unknown in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) with mild to moderate disability.

Summary of review: Relevant studies were identified from the three electronic databases (i) MEDLINE via Pubmed, (ii) Scopus, and (iii) IEEE Xplore from inception to 1st December 2020. Out of 12,626 studies identified, 40 used machine learning for ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke risk prediction models. Synthesis without meta-analysis identified that a boosting algorithm (median C-statistics = 0.9 (interquartile range [IQR]: 0.88-0.92)), and neural network (median C-statistic = 0.80 (IQR: 0.77-0.92)) performed best among ML models in the low risk of bias studies. Moreover, a boosting algorithm also performed best in overall (both low and high risk of bias) studies (median C-statistic = 0.92 (IQR: 0.90-0.95)). Conclusions: The systematic review found promising results of the ML algorithm model performances compare with the gold standard conventional models, such as FSRP (C-statistic 0.653) and revised FSRP (C-statistic 0.716). In term of the algorithm, boosting and neural networks are robust, but are considered as black-box models, since they are composed of non-linearity and complex algorithms. It remains questionable whether a physician would adapt these algorithms to use in a real clinical setting. Moreover, less than half of the studies (16 out of 40) were at low risk of bias in our systematic review.

The impact of rurality on CVD outcomes needs to be fully elucidated. Objectives The purpose of this study was to assess the difference in mortality, readmission within 30 days, total readmissions, survival, and total emergency department (ED) presentations following an index CVD admission among patients from rural or remote areas as compared to metropolitan areas. Methods This retrospective observational study included all index hospitalizations with heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation (AF), or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) within the Hunter New England region of Australia, between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2021. Results There were 27,995 ACS admissions, 15,586 HF admissions, and 16,935 AF admissions. Patients from a rural or remote area presenting with CVD presentations had increased 30-day readmission (OR: 1.19; P < 0.001), an increased number of readmissions (incident rate ratio: 1.19; P < 0.001), and more ED presentations (incident rate ratio: 1.39; P < 0.001) as compared to patients from metropolitan areas. This was consistent across patients presenting with ACS, HF, and AF. There was no difference in mortality (HR: 1.01; P = 0.515). However, in the ACS subgroup, there was increased mortality in the rural and remote population (HR: 1.05; P = 0.015).

Subsequent experiments revealed that NIPSNAP1 promotes cancer cell proliferation and inhibits P27-dependent induction of senescence via dual mechanisms. Firstly, NIPSNAP1 maintains the levels of c-Myc by sequestering the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXL14 to prevent the proteasome-mediated turnover of c-Myc. Intriguingly, NIPSNAP1 levels are restrained by transcriptional repression mediated by c-Myc-Miz1, with repression lifted in response to serum withdrawal, thus identifying feedback regulation between NIPSNAP1 and c-Myc. Secondly, NIPSNAP1 was shown to modulate ROS levels by promoting interactions between the deacetylase SIRT3 and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2). Consequent activation of SOD2 serves to maintain cellular ROS levels below the critical levels required to induce cell cycle arrest and senescence.

Practical diagrams were developed to facilitate clinical decision-making. The initial evaluation involves screening for red flag signs requiring urgent attention, followed by a detailed history-taking and physical examination.

We aimed to test whether sex differences associated with BW phenotype were reproducible using a Mendelian randomization approach, i.e., association between polygenic score (PGS) for BW and behavior outcomes across childhood and adolescence. Methods Using data from the Raine Study, we had 1484 genotyped participants with a total of 6446 Child Behavior Checklist assessments from ages 5 to 17 years. We used BW-PGSs in linear mixed-effect models to predict parentally assessed attention, aggression, and social problems scales; we also derived estimates and significance for a sex-by-genotype interaction. We used a Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold and tested robustness of the results with teacher assessments of behavior and a second PGS. Results We found a sex-by-genotype interaction with lower BW-PGSs associated with increased aggression in males compared with females. These findings were consistent across various analyses, including teacher assessments. Surprisingly, a lower BW-PGS showed protective effects in females, while a lower BW phenotype had detrimental effects in males with evidence of a genotype-phenotype mismatch increasing aggression problems in males only.

Analysis identified four policy themes: changes to excise duty within existing tax structures, structural reforms, industry measures, and hypothecation of tax revenue for public benefits. For alcohol, policy options focused on raising the price of cheap, high-strength alcohol. For tobacco, policy options focused on raising the price of all tobacco products, especially the cheapest products, which are hand-rolling tobacco. For alcohol and tobacco, there were options such as levies that take money from the industries to help reduce the societal costs of their products. Due to the perceived social and economic importance of alcohol in contrast to tobacco, policy options also discussed supporting pubs and small breweries. Conclusions: This review has identified a set of tax policy options for tobacco and alcohol, their objectives, evidence of effects and related mediating factors. The differences between alcohol and tobacco tax policy options and debates suggest an opportunity for cross-substance policy learning.</ns3:p>", "source": "crossref"}, {"Publication_ID": 552122, "title": "Evidence of redox imbalance and mitochondrial dysfunction in Niemann-Pick type C 1 patients: the&#xa0;in vitro effect of combined therapy with antioxidants and &#x3b2;-cyclodextrin nanoparticles.", "doi": "10.1007/S11011-022-01128-9", "abstract": "Niemann-Pick C disease (NPC) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder resulting from mutation in one of two cholesterol transport genes: NPC1 or NPC2, causing accumulation of unesterified cholesterol, together with glycosphingolipids, within the endosomal/lysosomal compartment of cells. The result is a severe disease in both multiple peripheral organs and the central nervous system, causing neurodegeneration and early death. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms of NPC1 remain poorly understood. Recent studies have shown that the primary lysosomal defect found in fibroblasts from NPC1 patients is accompanied by a deregulation of mitochondrial organization and function. There is currently no cure for NPC1, but recently the potential of &#x3b2;-cyclodextrin (&#x3b2;-CD) for the treatment of the disease was discovered, which resulted in the redistribution of cholesterol from subcellular compartments to the circulation and increased longevity in an animal model of NPC1. Considering the above, the present work evaluated the in vitro therapeutic potential of &#x3b2;-CD to reduce cholesterol in fibroblasts from NPC1 patients. &#x3b2;-CD was used in its free and nanoparticulate form. We also evaluated the &#x3b2;-CD potential to restore mitochondrial functions, as well as the beneficial combined effects of treatment with antioxidants N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) and Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). Besides, we evaluated oxidative and nitrative stress parameters in NPC1 patients. We showed that oxidative and nitrative stress could contribute to the pathophysiology of NPC1, as the levels of lipoperoxidation and the nitrite and nitrate levels were increased in these patients when compared to healthy individuals, as well as DNA damage. The nanoparticles containing &#x3b2;-CD reduced the cholesterol accumulated in the NPC1 fibroblasts. This result was potentiated by the concomitant use of the nanoparticles with the antioxidants NAC and CoQ10 compared to those presented by healthy individuals cells &#x301;. In addition, treatments combining &#x3b2;-CD nanoparticles and antioxidants could reduce mitochondrial oxidative stress, demonstrating advantages compared to free &#x3b2;-CD.

The excited electrons of these FQDs are withdrawn by fluorine ions with high electronegativity, thereby inhibiting photoluminescence emission. FQDs are used for the detection of Fe2+, Fe3+, and Hg2+ ions through photoluminescence (PL) quenching, and the excited electrons are transferred between the F-doped QDs and these transition metal ions, reducing the PL emission. The LOD (limit of detection) values of Fe2+ and Hg2+ ions for CNQD were 0.423 and 0.438 ppm, respectively, whereas 3FQD exhibited an LOD value of 0.262 ppm for Fe2+, and 10FQD had an LOD value of 0.218 ppm for Hg2+ ions.

However, when challenged by endogenous or exogenous stressors, these proteostasis pathways can become dysregulated with detrimental consequences for protein fate, cell survival, and overall organism health. Most notably, there are numerous somatic pathologies associated with a loss of proteostatic regulation, including neurodegenerative disorders, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. <b><i>Recent Advances:</i></b> Lipid oxidation-derived reactive carbonyl species (RCS), such as 4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE) and malondialdehyde, are relatively underappreciated purveyors of proteostatic dysregulation, which elicit their effects <i>via</i> the nonenzymatic post-translational modification of proteins.

Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT), a strong evidence-based behavioral parent training program used for young children with behavior issues, has been used in its traditional form with increasing frequency with children and families who have trauma histories, with clinicians tailoring PCIT to use with children who have experienced trauma. Trauma-Directed Interaction (TDI) is a new systematic adaption to the standard PCIT parent training program that has the potential to help treat trauma in younger children. TDI includes several trauma-informed techniques that are added to a course of standard PCIT treatment including psychoeducation regarding trauma, recognition of feelings, and emotional regulation. This case study illustrates the use of a manualized trauma adaptation to PCIT (TDI) with a three-year-old boy who had a history of child maltreatment and his caregiver. This case provides a summary of the progression of this intervention and the results obtained. Results from the case indicated that TDI treatment was effective in not only reducing child trauma and behavioral symptoms but also in reducing mild caregiver mental health concerns. The next steps for TDI treatment and need for further research are discussed. </jats:p>", "source": "crossref"}, {"Publication_ID": 579946, "title": "Task-specific training versus usual care to improve upper limb function after stroke: the \u201cTask-AT Home\u201d randomised controlled trial protocol", "doi": "10.3389/FNEUR.2023.1140017", "abstract": "<jats:sec><jats:title>Background</jats:title><jats:p>Sixty percent of people have non-functional arms 6\u2009months after stroke.

Fault diagnosis (FD) methods play an important role in the safe operation of EPBS, and have been active research direction. The literature is considerably on studies concerned with new fault diagnosis methods, while how to quantitatively validate these methods for EPBS is quite few. The main attribute is the difficulty of obtaining fault data due to the long-term normal operation. Besides, fault experiments on the real platform are hard to control, and the cost is high. Therefore, this paper presents a new open-source benchmark for validating the FD methods of EPBS. Initially, we review the existing pure datasets and benchmarks available for validating FD methods, revealing a notable absence of a benchmark specially designed for EPBS. Then, the normal and fault models of EPBS are established and implemented by co-simulation of AMESim and MATLAB/Simulink. The fault models include brake cylinder faults, train pipe faults, EP valve faults, and sensor faults. Additionally, a GUI interface is developed to visually present the validation results.

Results showed that FePBC increased the rice yield under both CF (47.4%) and IF (19.6%) conditions, compared to the controls. Grain As concentration was higher under CF (1.94\u20132.42\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u22121) than IF conditions (1.56\u20132.31\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u22121), whereas the concentration of grain Pb was higher under IF (0.10\u20130.76\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u22121) than CF (0.12\u20130.48\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u22121) conditions.

Therefore, application of the multiple-functionalized biochar can be a promising strategy for increasing rice yield and reducing the accumulation of As in rice grain, particularly under IF conditions, whereas it is inapplicable for remediation of paddy soils contaminated with Pb.\n               ", "source": "elsevier"}, {"Publication_ID": 580522, "title": "Providing clinicians with \u2018how to\u2019 knowledge for technology\u2010based innovation: Introducing the <scp>SMS4dads</scp> texts", "doi": "10.1002/HPJA.778", "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:sec><jats:title>Issue Addressed</jats:title><jats:p>Male partners are key supports for women in birth preparation and postnatally.
