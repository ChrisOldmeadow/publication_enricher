However, the effects of tDCS on the cognitive-cerebral oxygenation interaction remains unclear. Further, oxygenation variability across individuals remains minimally controlled for. The purpose of this sham-controlled study was to test the effects of anodal tDCS over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on the interaction between working memory and cerebral oxygenation while controlling for individual oxygenation variability. Thirty-three adults received resting-state functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) recordings over bilateral prefrontal cortices. Following this, working memory was tested using a Toulouse n-back task concurrently paired with fNIRS, with measurements taken before and after 20&#xa0;min of anodal or sham tDCS at 1.5&#xa0;mA. With individual oxygenation controlled for, anodal tDCS was found to increase the oxyhemoglobin concentration over the right DLPFC during the 2-back (q = .015) and 3-back (q = .008) conditions. Additionally, anodal tDCS was found to improve accuracy during the 3-back task by 13.4 % (p&#xa0;= .028) and decrease latency by 250&#xa0;ms (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.013). The increase in oxyhemoglobin was strongly correlated with increases in accuracy (p&#xa0;= .041) and decreases in latency during the 3-back span (p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.017).

This study demonstrates the promotion effect of SiNP amendment on phytolith development and explores the associated mechanisms of TTM encapsulation in wheat phytoliths grown on multi-TTM contaminated soil. The bioconcentration factors between organic tissues and phytoliths of As and Cr (> 1) were significantly higher than those of Cd, Pb, Zn and Cu, and about 10\u00a0% and 40\u00a0% of the total As and Cr that bioaccumulated in wheat organic tissues were encapsulated into the corresponding phytoliths under high-level SiNP treatment. These observations demonstrate that the potential interaction of plant silica with TTMs is highly variable among elements, with As and Cr being the two most strongly concentrated TTMs in the phytoliths of wheat treated with SiNPs. The qualitative and semi-quantitative analyses of the phytoliths extracted from wheat tissues suggest that the high pore space and surface area (\u2248 200 m2 g\u22121) of phytolith particles could have contributed to the embedding of TTMs during silica gel polymerization and concentration to form PhytTTMs. The abundant SiO functional groups and high silicate-minerals in phytoliths are dominant chemical mechanisms for the preferential encapsulation of TTMs (i.e., As and Cr) by wheat phytoliths. Notably, the organic carbon and bioavailable Si of soils and the translocation of minerals from soil to plant aerial parts can impact TTM sequestration by phytoliths.

Tranexamic acid (TXA), an antifibrinolytic agent, can reduce bleeding in traumatic injuries and potentially enhance outcomes. Previous reviews suggested potential TXA benefits but did not consider the latest trials. Methods A systematic review and bias-adjusted meta-analysis were performed to assess TXA\u2019s effectiveness in emergency traumatic injury settings by pooling estimates from randomized controlled trials. Researchers searched Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central for randomized controlled trials comparing TXA\u2019s effects to a placebo in emergency trauma cases. The primary endpoint was 1-month mortality. The methodological quality of the trials underwent assessment using the MASTER scale, and the meta-analysis applied the quality-effects method to adjust for methodological quality. Results Seven randomized controlled trials met the set criteria. This meta-analysis indicated an 11% decrease in the death risk at 1 month after TXA use (odds ratio [OR] 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84 to 0.95) with a number needed to treat of 61 to avoid 1 additional death. The meta-analysis also revealed reduced 24-hour mortality (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.88) for TXA. No compelling evidence of increased vascular occlusive events emerged (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.27).

There is a spectrum of local effects following snakebite, including pain, swelling, bluish discolouration, haemorrhagic blistering, local tissue necrosis and gangrene at the bite site. In severe local envenomings, significant tissue loss and impaired function can occur and may result in permanent disability in snakebite survivors. Although the mainstay of hospital treatment for snake envenoming is antivenom, its effectiveness for local effects remains contentious. \u00a0The preclinical efficacy of antivenoms against the local effects of envenoming is examined with a range of in-vivo and in-vitro tests. Most of these tests are only capable of examining the ability of the antivenom to prevent, rather than reverse, the local effect. A limitation of the above tests is that they do not consider venom pharmacokinetics or the time course of irreversible effects in envenomed humans. Therefore, more clinically relevant experimental models of antivenom efficacy are required. We searched MEDLINE for studies on the local effects of snakebite. The current clinical literature on the effectiveness of antivenom for local effects appears to be limited. We identified only two randomised trials that compared antivenom with placebo and six randomised trials that tested the effectiveness of one antivenom or one dosage regimen of an antivenom compared to another antivenom or different dosage of antivenom for preventing or reversing the local effects.

By using a human-relevant large animal model, the domestic boar, this study focuses on furthering our understanding of the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in sperm capacitation. The UPS is a universal, evolutionarily conserved, cellular proteome-wide degradation and recycling machinery, that has been shown to play a significant role in reproduction during the past two decades. Herein, we have used a bottom-up proteomic approach to (i) monitor the capacitation-related changes in the sperm protein levels, and (ii) identify the targets of UPS regulation during sperm capacitation. Spermatozoa were capacitated under proteasomal activity-permissive and inhibiting conditions and extracted sperm proteins were subjected to high-resolution mass spectrometry. We report that 401 individual proteins differed at least two-fold in abundance (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) after in vitro capacitation (IVC) and 13 proteins were found significantly different (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) between capacitated spermatozoa with proteasomal inhibition compared to the vehicle control. These proteins were associated with biological processes including sperm capacitation, sperm motility, metabolism, binding to zona pellucida, and proteasome-mediated catabolism. Changes in RAB2A, CFAP161, and TTR during IVC were phenotyped by immunocytochemistry, image-based flow cytometry, and Western blotting. We conclude that (i) the sperm proteome is subjected to extensive remodeling during sperm capacitation, and (ii) the UPS has a narrow range of distinct protein substrates during capacitation. This knowledge highlights the importance of the UPS in sperm capacitation and offers opportunities to identify novel pharmacological targets to modulate sperm fertilizing ability for the benefit of human reproductive health, assisted reproductive therapy, and contraception, as well as reproductive management in food animal agriculture.", "pmid": "39215164", "source": "pubmed", "match_info": {"fuzzy_matched": false, "query_doi": "10.1038/S41598-024-71056-4", "match_type": "doi"}}, {"Publication_ID": 578242, "title": "Figure S2: The total follow-up period (time from diagnosis to end of the study) of articles included in this review, sorted by end of the study period. from A Review of the Application of Spatial Survival Methods in Cancer Research: Trends, Modeling, and Visualization Techniques", "doi": "10.1158/1055-9965.23516009.V1", "abstract": "<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;Supplementary Figure S2 shows article's study period in years&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>", "source": "crossref", "match_info": {"fuzzy_matched": false, "query_doi": "10.1158/1055-9965.23516009.V1", "match_type": "doi"}}, {"Publication_ID": 574122, "title": "Examining Whether Loss of Consciousness Is Associated with Worse Performance on the SCAT5 and Slower Clinical Recovery after Concussion in Professional Athletes", "doi": "10.1089/NEU.2022.0043"}, {"Publication_ID": 575989, "title": "The impact of pandemic disruptions on clinical skills learning for pre-clinical medical students: implications for future educational designs", "doi": "10.1186/s12909-023-04351-9", "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:sec><jats:title>Background</jats:title><jats:p>Pandemic disruptions to medical education worldwide resulted in rapid adaptations to clinical skills learning.

Methods A final sample of 93 refugee participants (48 with DSM-5 PTSD or sub-syndromal PTSD and 45 matched trauma-exposed controls) completed a 5-minute resting state fMRI scan to enable the observation of connectivity in the DMN and other core networks. A self-construal index was calculated by substracting scores on the collectivistic and individualistic sub-scales of the Self Construal Scale. Results Independent components analysis identified 9 active networks-of-interest, and functional network connectivity was determined. A significant interaction effect between PTSD and self-construal index was observed in the anterior ventromedial DMN, with spatial maps localizing this to the left ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), extending to the ventral anterior cingulate cortex. This effect revealed that connectivity in the vMPFC showed greater reductions in those with PTSD with higher levels of collectivistic self-construal.

This study investigated mismatch negativity (MMN) using a passive listening task and P3b in an active auditory go/no-go discrimination task.

Older children with ADHD exhibited smaller P3b amplitudes, while younger autistic children showed reduced MMN amplitudes in response to phoneme changes compared to their NT counterparts. Notably, children diagnosed with autism and ADHD did not follow this pattern; instead, they exhibited more similarities to NT children. The reduced amplitudes of phonetically elicited MMN in children with autism and reduced P3b in children with ADHD suggest that the two respective ERPs can act as potential biomarkers for each condition.

Two reviewers independently screened and assessed the quality of articles using Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal tools. A narrative analysis was used to synthesize and interpret the data to understand the effects of online interventions on lifestyle modifications. Results A total of 4063 citations underwent screening, resulting in 32 articles being deemed eligible and included in this review. Most studies examined physical activity (n = 14), followed by obesity (n = 7) and smoking (n = 6), Most studies were conducted in the USA (n = 14) and Australia (n = 11). Websites were the most utilised mode of intervention delivery (n = 11), followed by Facebook (n = 7) and mobile apps (n = 5).

Tumor-intrinsic T-cell deficiency and T-cell dysfunction have been identified as essential factors in the emergence of ICB resistance. Here, we found that protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) expression was inversely correlated with the number and activity of CD8+ T cells within melanoma specimen. PRMT1 deficiency or inhibition with DCPT1061 significantly restrained refractory melanoma growth and increased intratumoral CD8+ T cells in vivo. Moreover, PRMT1 deletion in melanoma cells facilitated formation of double-stranded RNA derived from endogenous retroviral elements (ERV) and stimulated an intracellular interferon response. Mechanistically, PRMT1 deficiency repressed the expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) by attenuating modification of H4R3me2a and H3K27ac at enhancer regions of Dnmt1, and DNMT1 downregulation consequently activated ERV transcription and the interferon signaling. Importantly, PRMT1 inhibition with DCPT1061 synergized with PD-1 blockade to suppress tumor progression and increase the proportion of CD8+ T cells as well as IFN\u03b3+CD8+ T cells in vivo. Together, these results reveal an unrecognized role and mechanism of PRMT1 in regulating antitumor T-cell immunity, suggesting PRMT1 inhibition as a potent strategy to increase the efficacy of ICB.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Significance:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Targeting PRMT1 stimulates interferon signaling by increasing expression of endogenous retroviral elements and double-stranded RNA through repression of DNMT1, which induces antitumor immunity and synergizes with immunotherapy to suppress tumor progression.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>", "source": "crossref", "match_info": {"fuzzy_matched": false, "query_doi": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-23-1082", "match_type": "doi"}}, {"Publication_ID": 559308, "title": "Establishment and characterization of oviductal organoids from farm and companion animals", "doi": "10.1093/BIOLRE/IOAD030", "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Organoid technology has provided a unique opportunity to study early human development and decipher various steps involved in the pathogenesis of disease.

Three main themes were identified through collaborative thematic analysis: making meaningful contributions from a marginalized position; finding our pedagogical feet; and recognizing the translational applicability and value of QR. We reflected on the marginalized positioning of QM in medical curricula and the underestimation of the value of QR to understanding pressing health issues. Analysis of these reflections pointed to a lack of formal training for educators and curriculum space for qualitative approaches. Our teaching pedagogies, developed through our own research experiences, self-reflection and student feedback, were primarily student-centered employing a range of novel approaches designed to foster skills and interest in the craft of QR, and introduce a greater appreciation of the significance of QR approaches to medicine. CAE further allowed us to identify some key recommendations that could help medical educators plan for teaching QM and other research methods more effectively in medicine. Future curriculum development should consider the benefits of exposing learners to a range of methods and approaches from across the qualitative-quantitative spectrum.</jats:p>", "source": "crossref", "match_info": {"fuzzy_matched": false, "query_doi": "10.1007/S10459-023-10224-Z", "match_type": "doi"}}, {"Publication_ID": 539213, "title": "Improved Soft Actor-Critic: Mixing Prioritized Off-Policy Samples With On-Policy Experiences", "doi": "10.1109/TNNLS.2022.3174051"}, {"Publication_ID": 611283, "title": "Whose side are you on?", "doi": "10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190641184.003.0002", "abstract": "<p>The board of directors has a fiduciary duty to the shareholders who elect its members to monitor, advise, and if necessary replace the CEO and other senior executives.

Therefore, the aim of the current study was to explore changes in urinary metabolomic profiles during and after a 10-week weight loss intervention where participants were prescribed a high F and V diet (7 servings daily). Methods: Adults with overweight and obesity (n = 34) received medical nutrition therapy counselling to increase their F and V intakes to national targets (7 servings a day). Data collection included weight, dietary intake, and urine samples at baseline at week 2 and week 10. Urinary metabolite profiles were quantified using 1H NMR spectroscopy. Machine learning statistical approaches were employed to identify novel urine-based metabolite biomarkers associated with high F and V diet patterns at weeks 2 and 10. Metabolic changes appearing in urine in response to diet were quantified using Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis (MSEA). Results: Energy intake was significantly lower (p = 0.02) at week 10 compared with baseline. Total F and V intake was significantly higher at week 2 and week 10 (p &lt; 0.05). In total, 123 urinary metabolites were quantified. At week 10, 21 metabolites showed significant changes relative to baseline. Of these, 11 metabolites also significantly changed at week 2.

Design: A cross-sectional analysis of observational data from the baseline of the ACTIVate study. Participants: The cohort included 426 cognitively normal adults aged 60\u201370 years. Methods: The Australian Eating Survey (AES) Food Frequency Questionnaire was used to collect data on usual dietary intake, along with additional questions assessing intake of dietary oils. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the dimensionality of dietary data. Cardiometabolic risk was quantified using the metabolic syndrome severity score (MetSSS). Tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) were used to derive composite scores on four cognitive domains: processing speed, executive function, short-term memory, and long-term memory. Results: Three dietary patterns were identified using PCA: a plant-dominant diet, a Western-style diet, and a meat-dominant diet. After controlling for age, sex, total years of education, energy intake, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), there was a small, negative association between the meat-dominant diets and long-term memory.
