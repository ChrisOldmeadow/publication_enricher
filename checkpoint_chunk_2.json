However, the effects of tDCS on the cognitive-cerebral oxygenation interaction remains unclear. Further, oxygenation variability across individuals remains minimally controlled for. The purpose of this sham-controlled study was to test the effects of anodal tDCS over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on the interaction between working memory and cerebral oxygenation while controlling for individual oxygenation variability. Thirty-three adults received resting-state functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) recordings over bilateral prefrontal cortices. Following this, working memory was tested using a Toulouse n-back task concurrently paired with fNIRS, with measurements taken before and after 20\u00a0min of anodal or sham tDCS at 1.5\u00a0mA. With individual oxygenation controlled for, anodal tDCS was found to increase the oxyhemoglobin concentration over the right DLPFC during the 2-back (q = .015) and 3-back (q = .008) conditions. Additionally, anodal tDCS was found to improve accuracy during the 3-back task by 13.4 % (p\u00a0= .028) and decrease latency by 250\u00a0ms (p\u00a0=\u00a0.013). The increase in oxyhemoglobin was strongly correlated with increases in accuracy (p\u00a0= .041) and decreases in latency during the 3-back span (p\u00a0=\u00a0.017).

During the course of this study, a simplified embryo grading system was developed for both in vivo- and in vitro-derived embryos that proved to be significantly associated with both embryo metabolism and survival rates following transfer into a recipient mare. A total of 15 in vivo derived embryos and 32 ICSI-derived embryos were cultured in protein free synthetic oviduct fluid (SOF) for 24h between day 8 and day 9 of development. Aliquots of 10\u00b5L of media before culture (t=0) and spent media after culture (t=24h) were snap frozen for subsequent analysis by GC-Mass Spectrometry for glucose, lactate and pyruvate. The embryos were photographed and classified as grade 1, 2 or 3 based on the percentage of extruded debris between the trophoblast and the zona pellucida. In this study the sex of the embryos (in vivo n\u202f=\u202f5, ICSI n\u202f=\u202f25) was determined by PCR. At day 8 of development, the embryo metabolism of glucose, pyruvate and lactate in relation to embryo origin (in vivo vs in vitro), grade and sex wasevaluated following 24h of culture in protein free media. Overall, there was a positive correlation between embryo volume and lactate peak area (r2\u202f=\u202f88.2%, p \u2264 0.001) and a negative correlation with both glucose peak area (r2\u202f=\u202f29.8%, p =0.023) and pyruvate peak area (r2\u202f=\u202f46.2%, p =0.003) in the spent media. These results illustrated that as embryo volume increased, the amount of glucose and pyruvate in the media decreased and the production of lactate increased. After accounting for embryo volume, general linear model analysis revealed an effect of embryo grade (p =0.031), but no significant effect of embryo sex or origin on lactate consumption over 24h. Grade 2 embryos, however, consumed more lactate than Grade 1 embryos (p\u202f=\u202f0.029). In conclusion, the metabolic relationships between glucose, lactate and pyruvate were described for both in vivo- and in vitro-derived equine embryos in this study.

This study demonstrates the promotion effect of SiNP amendment on phytolith development and explores the associated mechanisms of TTM encapsulation in wheat phytoliths grown on multi-TTM contaminated soil. The bioconcentration factors between organic tissues and phytoliths of As and Cr (> 1) were significantly higher than those of Cd, Pb, Zn and Cu, and about 10\u00a0% and 40\u00a0% of the total As and Cr that bioaccumulated in wheat organic tissues were encapsulated into the corresponding phytoliths under high-level SiNP treatment. These observations demonstrate that the potential interaction of plant silica with TTMs is highly variable among elements, with As and Cr being the two most strongly concentrated TTMs in the phytoliths of wheat treated with SiNPs. The qualitative and semi-quantitative analyses of the phytoliths extracted from wheat tissues suggest that the high pore space and surface area (\u2248 200 m2 g\u22121) of phytolith particles could have contributed to the embedding of TTMs during silica gel polymerization and concentration to form PhytTTMs. The abundant SiO functional groups and high silicate-minerals in phytoliths are dominant chemical mechanisms for the preferential encapsulation of TTMs (i.e., As and Cr) by wheat phytoliths. Notably, the organic carbon and bioavailable Si of soils and the translocation of minerals from soil to plant aerial parts can impact TTM sequestration by phytoliths.

BrainGPT, an LLM we tuned on the neuroscience literature, performed better yet. Like human experts, when LLMs indicated high confidence in their predictions, their responses were more likely to be correct, which presages a future where LLMs assist humans in making discoveries. Our approach is not neuroscience specific and is transferable to other knowledge-intensive endeavours.</jats:p>", "source": "crossref", "match_info": {"fuzzy_matched": false, "query_doi": "10.1038/S41562-024-02046-9", "match_type": "doi"}}, {"Publication_ID": 556445, "title": "\u2018They don't really know why they're here\u2019 mental health professionals' perspectives of consumer representatives", "doi": "10.1111/INM.13124", "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>There are several barriers to meaningful, non\u2010tokenistic consumer representation in mental health, including stigma and negative attitudes towards consumers.

Despite using intensive chemotherapy and allogeneic stem cell transplantation, the treatment options for AML remain open for innovation. Thus, there is a need to explore alternative therapies such as less toxic targeted therapies in AML. Aurora A kinase is a well-established target for the treatment of various cancers, including AML. This kinase plays a pivotal role in the cell-division cycle, particularly in different stages of mitosis, and is also involved in many other cellular regulatory processes. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the anti-viral drug rilpivirine is an Aurora A kinase inhibitor. In the current study, we have further explored the selectivity of rilpivirine for Aurora A kinase inhibition by testing this drug against a panel of 429 kinases. Concurrently, we demonstrated that rilpivirine significantly inhibited the proliferation of AML cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner that was preceded by G2/M cell-cycle arrest leading to the induction of apoptosis. Consistent with its kinase inhibitory role, rilpivirine modulated the expression of critical proteins in the Aurora A kinase-signalling pathway. Importantly, orally administered rilpivirine significantly inhibited tumour growth in an HL-60 xenograft model without showing body weight changes or other clinical signs of toxicity. Furthermore, rilpivirine enhanced the anti-proliferative efficacy of the conventional anti-leukaemic chemotherapeutic agent cytarabine.

Tranexamic acid (TXA), an antifibrinolytic agent, can reduce bleeding in traumatic injuries and potentially enhance outcomes. Previous reviews suggested potential TXA benefits but did not consider the latest trials. Methods A systematic review and bias-adjusted meta-analysis were performed to assess TXA\u2019s effectiveness in emergency traumatic injury settings by pooling estimates from randomized controlled trials. Researchers searched Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central for randomized controlled trials comparing TXA\u2019s effects to a placebo in emergency trauma cases. The primary endpoint was 1-month mortality. The methodological quality of the trials underwent assessment using the MASTER scale, and the meta-analysis applied the quality-effects method to adjust for methodological quality. Results Seven randomized controlled trials met the set criteria. This meta-analysis indicated an 11% decrease in the death risk at 1 month after TXA use (odds ratio [OR] 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84 to 0.95) with a number needed to treat of 61 to avoid 1 additional death. The meta-analysis also revealed reduced 24-hour mortality (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.88) for TXA. No compelling evidence of increased vascular occlusive events emerged (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.27). Subgroup analyses highlighted TXA\u2019s effectiveness in general trauma versus traumatic brain injury and survival advantages when administered out-of-hospital versus inhospital. Conclusions This synthesis demonstrates that TXA use for trauma in emergencies leads to a reduction in 1-month mortality, with no significant evidence of problematic vascular occlusive events.

There is a spectrum of local effects following snakebite, including pain, swelling, bluish discolouration, haemorrhagic blistering, local tissue necrosis and gangrene at the bite site. In severe local envenomings, significant tissue loss and impaired function can occur and may result in permanent disability in snakebite survivors. Although the mainstay of hospital treatment for snake envenoming is antivenom, its effectiveness for local effects remains contentious. \u00a0The preclinical efficacy of antivenoms against the local effects of envenoming is examined with a range of in-vivo and in-vitro tests. Most of these tests are only capable of examining the ability of the antivenom to prevent, rather than reverse, the local effect. A limitation of the above tests is that they do not consider venom pharmacokinetics or the time course of irreversible effects in envenomed humans. Therefore, more clinically relevant experimental models of antivenom efficacy are required. We searched MEDLINE for studies on the local effects of snakebite. The current clinical literature on the effectiveness of antivenom for local effects appears to be limited. We identified only two randomised trials that compared antivenom with placebo and six randomised trials that tested the effectiveness of one antivenom or one dosage regimen of an antivenom compared to another antivenom or different dosage of antivenom for preventing or reversing the local effects. All these studies were on viperine envenomings. In addition, several studies without a control/comparative group have commented on antivenom effectiveness, although they invariably have significant bias. The existing studies had contrasting conclusions, including no effect of antivenom, antivenom halting the progression of local effects, early antivenom preventing the occurrence of severe local effects including necrosis, early antivenom leading to faster functional improvement, antivenom accelerating the resolution of local effects, or no conclusion.

Methods A final sample of 93 refugee participants (48 with DSM-5 PTSD or sub-syndromal PTSD and 45 matched trauma-exposed controls) completed a 5-minute resting state fMRI scan to enable the observation of connectivity in the DMN and other core networks. A self-construal index was calculated by substracting scores on the collectivistic and individualistic sub-scales of the Self Construal Scale. Results Independent components analysis identified 9 active networks-of-interest, and functional network connectivity was determined. A significant interaction effect between PTSD and self-construal index was observed in the anterior ventromedial DMN, with spatial maps localizing this to the left ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), extending to the ventral anterior cingulate cortex. This effect revealed that connectivity in the vMPFC showed greater reductions in those with PTSD with higher levels of collectivistic self-construal. Limitations This is an observational study and causality cannot be assumed. The specialized sample of refugees means that the findings may not generalize to other trauma-exposed populations. Conclusions Such a finding indicates that self-construal may shape the core neural architecture of PTSD, given that functional disruptions to the vmPFC underpin the core mechanisms of extinction learning, emotion dysregulation and self-referential processing in PTSD. Results have important implications for understanding the universality of neural disturbances in PTSD, and suggest that self-construal could be an important consideration in the assessment and treatment of post-traumatic stress reactions.", "source": "elsevier", "match_info": {"fuzzy_matched": false, "query_doi": "10.1016/J.JAD.2024.06.009", "match_type": "doi"}}, {"Publication_ID": 576035, "title": "A mixed methods evaluation of Quit for new life, a smoking cessation initiative for women having an Aboriginal baby", "doi": "10.1186/S12913-023-09496-3", "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Background</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Quit for new life (QFNL) is a smoking cessation initiative developed to support mothers of Aboriginal babies to quit smoking during pregnancy.

Older children with ADHD exhibited smaller P3b amplitudes, while younger autistic children showed reduced MMN amplitudes in response to phoneme changes compared to their NT counterparts. Notably, children diagnosed with autism and ADHD did not follow this pattern; instead, they exhibited more similarities to NT children. The reduced amplitudes of phonetically elicited MMN in children with autism and reduced P3b in children with ADHD suggest that the two respective ERPs can act as potential biomarkers for each condition.

Here, we found that protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) expression was inversely correlated with the number and activity of CD8+ T cells within melanoma specimen. PRMT1 deficiency or inhibition with DCPT1061 significantly restrained refractory melanoma growth and increased intratumoral CD8+ T cells in vivo. Moreover, PRMT1 deletion in melanoma cells facilitated formation of double-stranded RNA derived from endogenous retroviral elements (ERV) and stimulated an intracellular interferon response. Mechanistically, PRMT1 deficiency repressed the expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) by attenuating modification of H4R3me2a and H3K27ac at enhancer regions of Dnmt1, and DNMT1 downregulation consequently activated ERV transcription and the interferon signaling. Importantly, PRMT1 inhibition with DCPT1061 synergized with PD-1 blockade to suppress tumor progression and increase the proportion of CD8+ T cells as well as IFN\u03b3+CD8+ T cells in vivo. Together, these results reveal an unrecognized role and mechanism of PRMT1 in regulating antitumor T-cell immunity, suggesting PRMT1 inhibition as a potent strategy to increase the efficacy of ICB.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Significance:</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Targeting PRMT1 stimulates interferon signaling by increasing expression of endogenous retroviral elements and double-stranded RNA through repression of DNMT1, which induces antitumor immunity and synergizes with immunotherapy to suppress tumor progression.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>", "source": "crossref", "match_info": {"fuzzy_matched": false, "query_doi": "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-23-1082", "match_type": "doi"}}, {"Publication_ID": 559308, "title": "Establishment and characterization of oviductal organoids from farm and companion animals", "doi": "10.1093/BIOLRE/IOAD030", "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Organoid technology has provided a unique opportunity to study early human development and decipher various steps involved in the pathogenesis of disease.

Three main themes were identified through collaborative thematic analysis: making meaningful contributions from a marginalized position; finding our pedagogical feet; and recognizing the translational applicability and value of QR. We reflected on the marginalized positioning of QM in medical curricula and the underestimation of the value of QR to understanding pressing health issues. Analysis of these reflections pointed to a lack of formal training for educators and curriculum space for qualitative approaches. Our teaching pedagogies, developed through our own research experiences, self-reflection and student feedback, were primarily student-centered employing a range of novel approaches designed to foster skills and interest in the craft of QR, and introduce a greater appreciation of the significance of QR approaches to medicine. CAE further allowed us to identify some key recommendations that could help medical educators plan for teaching QM and other research methods more effectively in medicine. Future curriculum development should consider the benefits of exposing learners to a range of methods and approaches from across the qualitative-quantitative spectrum.</jats:p>", "source": "crossref", "match_info": {"fuzzy_matched": false, "query_doi": "10.1007/S10459-023-10224-Z", "match_type": "doi"}}, {"Publication_ID": 539213, "title": "Improved Soft Actor-Critic: Mixing Prioritized Off-Policy Samples With On-Policy Experiences", "doi": "10.1109/TNNLS.2022.3174051"}, {"Publication_ID": 611283, "title": "Whose side are you on?", "doi": "10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190641184.003.0002", "abstract": "<p>The board of directors has a fiduciary duty to the shareholders who elect its members to monitor, advise, and if necessary replace the CEO and other senior executives.

Methods: Adults with overweight and obesity (n = 34) received medical nutrition therapy counselling to increase their F and V intakes to national targets (7 servings a day). Data collection included weight, dietary intake, and urine samples at baseline at week 2 and week 10. Urinary metabolite profiles were quantified using 1H NMR spectroscopy. Machine learning statistical approaches were employed to identify novel urine-based metabolite biomarkers associated with high F and V diet patterns at weeks 2 and 10.
